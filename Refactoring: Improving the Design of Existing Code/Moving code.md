Sure! The process you've shared includes several refactorings related to **moving features**, such as moving functions, fields, or statements, and refactoring loops for better readability or performance. I'll explain each one in detail with **before** and **after** examples in **Swift**.

### 1. **Move Function**

**Motivation**:
Move a function when it references more elements from another class than its current class. This can improve encapsulation and make the code easier to understand and modify.

**Before**:
```swift
class Account {
    var daysOverdrawn: Int
    var type: AccountType

    init(daysOverdrawn: Int, type: AccountType) {
        self.daysOverdrawn = daysOverdrawn
        self.type = type
    }

    func overdraftCharge() -> Double {
        if type.isPremium {
            let baseCharge = 10.0
            if daysOverdrawn <= 7 {
                return baseCharge
            } else {
                return baseCharge + Double(daysOverdrawn - 7) * 0.85
            }
        } else {
            return Double(daysOverdrawn) * 1.75
        }
    }
}

class AccountType {
    var isPremium: Bool

    init(isPremium: Bool) {
        self.isPremium = isPremium
    }
}
```

**After**:
```swift
class Account {
    var daysOverdrawn: Int
    var type: AccountType

    init(daysOverdrawn: Int, type: AccountType) {
        self.daysOverdrawn = daysOverdrawn
        self.type = type
    }

    func overdraftCharge() -> Double {
        return type.overdraftCharge(daysOverdrawn)
    }
}

class AccountType {
    var isPremium: Bool

    init(isPremium: Bool) {
        self.isPremium = isPremium
    }

    func overdraftCharge(_ daysOverdrawn: Int) -> Double {
        let baseCharge = 10.0
        if isPremium {
            return daysOverdrawn <= 7 ? baseCharge : baseCharge + Double(daysOverdrawn - 7) * 0.85
        } else {
            return Double(daysOverdrawn) * 1.75
        }
    }
}
```

**Explanation**: The `overdraftCharge` method is moved from `Account` to `AccountType` since it relies more on information about the `AccountType`. This improves cohesion and better organizes the responsibility.

### 2. **Move Field**

**Motivation**:
Move a field when it logically belongs to another class. This helps in maintaining cleaner and more intuitive class structures.

**Before**:
```swift
class Customer {
    var discountRate: Double
    var contract: CustomerContract

    init(discountRate: Double, contract: CustomerContract) {
        self.discountRate = discountRate
        self.contract = contract
    }
}

class CustomerContract {
    var startDate: Date

    init(startDate: Date) {
        self.startDate = startDate
    }
}
```

**After**:
```swift
class Customer {
    var contract: CustomerContract

    init(discountRate: Double, startDate: Date) {
        self.contract = CustomerContract(startDate: startDate, discountRate: discountRate)
    }

    var discountRate: Double {
        get { return contract.discountRate }
        set { contract.discountRate = newValue }
    }
}

class CustomerContract {
    var startDate: Date
    var discountRate: Double

    init(startDate: Date, discountRate: Double) {
        self.startDate = startDate
        self.discountRate = discountRate
    }
}
```

**Explanation**: The `discountRate` logically belongs to `CustomerContract` as it is tied to the terms of the contract. By moving it, the relationship between the `Customer` and `CustomerContract` becomes more intuitive.

---

### 3. **Move Statements into Function**

**Motivation**:
If certain statements are always executed alongside a function call, moving them inside the function reduces duplication and makes the code cleaner.

**Before**:
```swift
func renderPerson(name: String, photo: Photo) -> String {
    var result = ""
    result += "<p>\(name)</p>"
    result += renderPhoto(photo)
    result += "<p>Title: \(photo.title)</p>"
    result += photoData(photo)
    return result
}

func photoData(_ photo: Photo) -> String {
    return "<p>Location: \(photo.location)</p>"
}
```

**After**:
```swift
func renderPerson(name: String, photo: Photo) -> String {
    var result = ""
    result += "<p>\(name)</p>"
    result += renderPhoto(photo)
    result += photoData(photo)
    return result
}

func photoData(_ photo: Photo) -> String {
    return """
    <p>Title: \(photo.title)</p>
    <p>Location: \(photo.location)</p>
    """
}
```

**Explanation**: The `photoData` function now includes the title, as it was always used together with the location. This reduces repetition in `renderPerson`.

---

### 4. **Move Statements to Callers**

**Motivation**:
If certain code inside a function needs to be customized or used differently by its callers, moving it out of the function can give callers more control.

**Before**:
```swift
func emitPhotoData(photo: Photo) -> String {
    var result = ""
    result += "<p>Title: \(photo.title)</p>"
    result += "<p>Location: \(photo.location)</p>"
    return result
}

let details = emitPhotoData(photo)
```

**After**:
```swift
func emitPhotoData(photo: Photo) -> String {
    return "<p>Title: \(photo.title)</p>"
}

let details = emitPhotoData(photo) + "<p>Location: \(photo.location)</p>"
```

**Explanation**: The `Location` detail is moved outside `emitPhotoData`, giving callers the flexibility to render the location differently if needed.

---

### 5. **Replace Inline Code with Function Call**

**Motivation**:
If you find similar inline code in multiple places, replacing it with a function call improves code reuse and reduces duplication.

**Before**:
```swift
let appliesToMassachusetts = states.contains("MA")
```

**After**:
```swift
func containsState(_ states: [String], state: String) -> Bool {
    return states.contains(state)
}

let appliesToMassachusetts = containsState(states, state: "MA")
```

**Explanation**: Replacing inline logic with a function call allows for consistent handling of state checks throughout the codebase.

---

### 6. **Split Loop**

**Motivation**:
Split a loop when it’s performing multiple tasks. This makes the code easier to understand and modify.

**Before**:
```swift
var totalSalary = 0.0
var youngestAge = Int.max

for person in people {
    totalSalary += person.salary
    if person.age < youngestAge {
        youngestAge = person.age
    }
}
```

**After**:
```swift
var totalSalary = people.reduce(0) { $0 + $1.salary }
var youngestAge = people.map { $0.age }.min() ?? Int.max
```

**Explanation**: The loop is split into two separate operations: calculating total salary and finding the youngest age. This makes the intent clearer and enables further optimizations like using Swift’s higher-order functions.

---

### 7. **Replace Loop with Pipeline**

**Motivation**:
Replace loops with collection pipelines (e.g., `map`, `filter`) for better readability and expressiveness.

**Before**:
```swift
var result: [String] = []
for person in people {
    if person.isActive {
        result.append(person.name)
    }
}
```

**After**:
```swift
let result = people.filter { $0.isActive }.map { $0.name }
```

**Explanation**: The loop is replaced with a `filter` and `map` combination, making it easier to read and understand the transformation of data.

---

### 8. **Substitute Algorithm**

**Motivation**:
Replace a complex algorithm with a simpler or more efficient one.

**Before**:
```swift
func findPerson(people: [String]) -> String? {
    for person in people {
        if person == "Don" || person == "John" || person == "Kent" {
            return person
        }
    }
    return nil
}
```

**After**:
```swift
func findPerson(people: [String]) -> String? {
    let candidates = ["Don", "John", "Kent"]
    return people.first { candidates.contains($0) }
}
```

**Explanation**: The manual loop is replaced with a simpler `first` method that checks if a person is in the list of candidates. This makes the code more concise and easier to understand.

---

These examples cover the process of moving functions, fields, and other code elements, as well as refactoring loops for better clarity. Each refactoring contributes to a more modular and maintainable codebase in Swift, making the software easier to understand and extend.
### 9. **Remove Dead Code**

**Motivation**:
Dead code is any code that is no longer used or needed. Removing it reduces clutter and makes the codebase easier to navigate and maintain. It’s also important for reducing the potential for bugs or confusion.

**Before**:
```swift
class User {
    var name: String
    var age: Int
    
    init(name: String, age: Int) {
        self.name = name
        self.age = age
    }
    
    func oldMethod() {
        print("This method is no longer used.")
    }
    
    func newMethod() {
        print("This is the current method.")
    }
}

let user = User(name: "Alice", age: 30)
user.newMethod()
```

**After**:
```swift
class User {
    var name: String
    var age: Int
    
    init(name: String, age: Int) {
        self.name = name
        self.age = age
    }
    
    func newMethod() {
        print("This is the current method.")
    }
}

let user = User(name: "Alice", age: 30)
user.newMethod()
```

**Explanation**:
The `oldMethod()` is removed because it is no longer used anywhere in the code. Eliminating such dead code makes the class simpler and easier to maintain.

---

### 10. **Slide Statements**

**Motivation**:
Slide statements when related lines of code are better grouped together for improved readability or when preparing for another refactoring like `Extract Function`. Moving related code closer makes the function’s structure clearer and easier to follow.

**Before**:
```swift
func calculateCharges() -> Double {
    let baseCharge = retrieveBaseCharge()
    let discount = calculateDiscount()
    
    var total = baseCharge
    total -= discount

    let additionalFee = calculateAdditionalFee()
    total += additionalFee
    
    return total
}
```

**After**:
```swift
func calculateCharges() -> Double {
    let baseCharge = retrieveBaseCharge()
    var total = baseCharge

    let discount = calculateDiscount()
    total -= discount

    let additionalFee = calculateAdditionalFee()
    total += additionalFee
    
    return total
}
```

**Explanation**:
The statement for `var total = baseCharge` is moved closer to where `baseCharge` is calculated, keeping related operations together. This makes it easier to understand the flow of calculations and ensures that each part of the charge calculation is clearly defined.

---

These three refactorings—**Substitute Algorithm**, **Remove Dead Code**, and **Slide Statements**—are part of improving code quality by either simplifying logic, reducing clutter, or improving the organization of statements. Each refactoring is aimed at making the code more understandable and maintainable, which ultimately contributes to a cleaner and more robust codebase.
