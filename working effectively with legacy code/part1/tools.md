### Tools for Working with Legacy Code: Overview

When working with legacy code, a variety of tools can help make the process smoother and more efficient. These tools include **editors/IDEs**, **build systems**, **testing frameworks**, and **automated refactoring tools**. Let’s break down each of these categories and explore how they apply to working with legacy code, with specific examples using Swift where applicable.

### 1. **Automated Refactoring Tools**

Refactoring tools automate the process of restructuring existing code without changing its behavior. This makes code easier to understand and modify, especially in large codebases.

- **Purpose**: These tools help clean up messy code, rename variables, extract methods, and make structural changes without altering the program's behavior.
- **Example Tools**:
  - Xcode (for Swift): Xcode includes basic refactoring tools like renaming variables, extracting methods, and re-organizing code structures.
  - AppCode (JetBrains): Offers more advanced refactoring options for Swift, such as method extraction and class restructuring.

#### Example in Swift:
Suppose you have a Swift class that needs some refactoring:

```swift
class UserProfile {
    private var firstName: String
    private var lastName: String
    
    init(firstName: String, lastName: String) {
        self.firstName = firstName
        self.lastName = lastName
    }
    
    func fullName() -> String {
        return "\(firstName) \(lastName)"
    }
}
```

**Using Refactoring Tools in Xcode**:
- **Rename Variable**: In Xcode, you can right-click on `firstName`, choose "Rename", and it will rename the variable throughout the project.
- **Extract Method**: You can select the code inside `fullName()` and extract it into a new method, such as `createFullName()`, making the code more modular.

These refactoring operations preserve the code's behavior but make it more readable and maintainable.

### 2. **Tests and Automated Refactoring**

Testing is essential when using automated refactoring tools to ensure that the code's behavior remains consistent. Even with safe refactoring tools, having a robust suite of tests can help catch unintended changes.

- **Purpose**: Tests ensure that automated changes do not introduce bugs.
- **Example**:
  - Write unit tests before refactoring a method to verify that its behavior remains consistent after the refactor.

#### Example in Swift with Tests:
Continuing with the `UserProfile` class:

```swift
import XCTest

class UserProfileTests: XCTestCase {
    func testFullName() {
        let profile = UserProfile(firstName: "John", lastName: "Doe")
        XCTAssertEqual(profile.fullName(), "John Doe")
    }
}
```

**Refactor and Verify**:
- After extracting the logic of `fullName()` into a new method, `createFullName()`, run `UserProfileTests` to ensure the `fullName()` method still returns the expected result.

```swift
class UserProfile {
    private var firstName: String
    private var lastName: String

    init(firstName: String, lastName: String) {
        self.firstName = firstName
        self.lastName = lastName
    }

    private func createFullName() -> String {
        return "\(firstName) \(lastName)"
    }

    func fullName() -> String {
        return createFullName()
    }
}
```

### 3. **Mock Objects**

In legacy code, classes often have dependencies that make testing difficult. **Mock objects** replace these dependencies with simplified versions that simulate their behavior.

- **Purpose**: Mocks help isolate the code under test by simulating interactions with other components, making it easier to test specific behaviors.
- **Example**: Using a mock to simulate a network call in a Swift class.

#### Example in Swift with Mocking:
Suppose we have a class `WeatherService` that fetches weather data:

```swift
protocol WeatherAPI {
    func fetchWeather(city: String, completion: @escaping (String) -> Void)
}

class WeatherService {
    private let api: WeatherAPI

    init(api: WeatherAPI) {
        self.api = api
    }

    func getWeatherForCity(_ city: String, completion: @escaping (String) -> Void) {
        api.fetchWeather(city: city, completion: completion)
    }
}
```

To test `WeatherService`, we can create a **mock object** for `WeatherAPI`:

```swift
class MockWeatherAPI: WeatherAPI {
    var weatherResponse: String = "Sunny"

    func fetchWeather(city: String, completion: @escaping (String) -> Void) {
        completion(weatherResponse)
    }
}
```

**Unit Test with the Mock Object**:

```swift
import XCTest

class WeatherServiceTests: XCTestCase {
    func testGetWeatherForCity() {
        let mockAPI = MockWeatherAPI()
        let service = WeatherService(api: mockAPI)
        let expectation = self.expectation(description: "Weather Fetch")
        
        service.getWeatherForCity("Berlin") { weather in
            XCTAssertEqual(weather, "Sunny")
            expectation.fulfill()
        }

        wait(for: [expectation], timeout: 1.0)
    }
}
```

In this test, `MockWeatherAPI` simulates the behavior of a real `WeatherAPI`, allowing `WeatherService` to be tested in isolation without making actual network requests.

### 4. **Unit-Testing Frameworks**

Testing frameworks are essential for writing and running tests. They allow you to verify that individual parts of your code work as expected.

- **Example Tools**:
  - **XCTest**: The primary unit testing framework for Swift.
  - **Quick/Nimble**: Third-party testing frameworks that provide a more expressive syntax for writing tests.

#### Example in Swift with `XCTest`:
Here’s a basic example of a test using `XCTest`:

```swift
import XCTest

class Calculator {
    func add(_ a: Int, _ b: Int) -> Int {
        return a + b
    }
}

class CalculatorTests: XCTestCase {
    func testAdd() {
        let calculator = Calculator()
        XCTAssertEqual(calculator.add(2, 3), 5)
    }
}
```

In Xcode, you can run this test by selecting the test navigator and running `CalculatorTests`. This verifies that the `add()` method of the `Calculator` class returns the expected sum.

### 5. **General Test Harnesses**

Beyond unit testing, there are tools that allow for testing broader scenarios, such as integration testing and acceptance testing.

- **Fitnesse/FIT**: A framework originally designed for Java that allows non-programmers to define tests using HTML tables. While not directly applicable to Swift, the concept of specifying high-level tests is valuable.
- **Example in Swift**: While there is no direct FIT equivalent, tools like **UI testing with Xcode** can provide some similar capabilities for defining user interactions and expected outcomes.

#### Example in Swift for UI Testing:

```swift
import XCTest

class WeatherAppUITests: XCTestCase {
    func testWeatherDisplay() {
        let app = XCUIApplication()
        app.launch()
        
        let searchField = app.textFields["SearchCity"]
        searchField.tap()
        searchField.typeText("Berlin")
        
        app.buttons["FetchWeather"].tap()
        
        let weatherLabel = app.staticTexts["WeatherLabel"]
        XCTAssertTrue(weatherLabel.exists)
        XCTAssertEqual(weatherLabel.label, "Sunny")
    }
}
```

This test simulates a user interaction in a weather app, verifying that the correct weather information is displayed. While this is a UI test, it demonstrates the idea of writing high-level tests that verify the interaction between different parts of the application.

### Summary:

- **Automated Refactoring Tools** like Xcode’s built-in refactoring make modifying legacy code easier without changing behavior.
- **Mock Objects** simulate dependencies, allowing isolated testing of classes like `WeatherService`.
- **Unit-Testing Frameworks** like `XCTest` provide the structure for writing and running tests in Swift.
- **General Test Harnesses** help validate more complex behaviors, similar to how tools like Fitnesse work for Java applications.

Together, these tools make it easier to manage and improve legacy code, ensuring that changes do not introduce new issues and that the code becomes more maintainable over time.
