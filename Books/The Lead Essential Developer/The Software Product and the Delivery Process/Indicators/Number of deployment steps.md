Counting the number of deployment steps is beneficial for understanding and optimizing the deployment pipeline. Here’s a strategic approach:

1. **Task Segmentation**: Break down the deployment process into modular steps (e.g., linting, testing, reporting, building). This segmented approach provides better insights into where the pipeline may face delays and allows for parallel execution where possible.

2. **Monitoring and Performance Tracking**: By isolating each step, monitoring becomes more precise, making it easier to identify bottlenecks. For instance, if the testing phase consistently takes longer than expected, you can target optimizations here without affecting the entire pipeline.

3. **Cost Analysis of Individual Steps**: Analyzing each deployment step helps in calculating resource usage and time costs, allowing for better budgeting and efficiency adjustments. 

4. **Iterative Feedback**: With granular steps, you gain faster feedback after each stage, enabling earlier detection of issues. This proactive setup can significantly reduce the time between finding and fixing problems, especially when combined with automated alerts on step failures.

Tracking these individual steps will enhance your pipeline’s transparency, enabling targeted improvements, more accurate assessments of modularity, and cost-effective scaling of the deployment process.
