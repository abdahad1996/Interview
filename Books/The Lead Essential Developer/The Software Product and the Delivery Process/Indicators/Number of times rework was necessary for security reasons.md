To ensure security doesn’t become a bottleneck in your development process, tracking the number of rework instances due to security reasons is helpful. This can indicate if issues frequently emerge after features are developed, highlighting potential areas where "shift-left security" practices can improve outcomes. Here’s a breakdown of how to implement these ideas:

1. **Tracking Security-Related Rework**: Set up automated logs that capture instances when builds fail or are reworked due to security issues, recording each time the issue impacts the release cycle.

2. **Training and Knowledge Sharing**: Address common security missteps through team training sessions, ideally led by a security specialist, to establish best practices and common pitfalls. This can improve team awareness and build a proactive security culture.

3. **Embedding Security Early (Shift-Left Security)**: Integrate security practices at the beginning of the development cycle. This could mean implementing security checks directly in the IDE, automated testing pipelines, or during code reviews.

By addressing security from the start, you can minimize late-stage rework, reduce bottlenecks, and improve overall productivity and security alignment across development stages.
