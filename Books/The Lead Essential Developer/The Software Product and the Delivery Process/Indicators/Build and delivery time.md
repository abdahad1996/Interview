Build and delivery time are critical metrics for assessing the efficiency of an automated pipeline. Build and delivery time are two of the most important build metrics to pay attention to. If it takes an hour to build and deliver your application, it means it would take at least one hour to fix an issue in production

**Key Points:**
- **Significance**: Long build and delivery times delay problem-solving in production, affecting responsiveness to issues.
- **Risk of Bypassing**: Quickly pushing a "fix build" without automated pipeline checks may solve immediate problems but can introduce greater risks by bypassing essential safety checks, like tests and validations.
- **Optimization**: A well-optimized pipeline should ideally complete in minutes—or even seconds, if achievable—minimizing wait time for developers and ensuring faster feedback loops.

**When to Act**: If build and delivery times consistently exceed acceptable limits, it's time to invest in improving the pipeline.
