## Number of regressions over time
Too many regressions (repeated bugs or mistakes) indicate the lack of an automated testing strategy to prevent mistakes from reoccurring.
Ideally, every reported bug should be fixed along with an automated test to prevent it from ever happening again. As a guideline, first prove the bug exists by writing a test (it should fail). Then go on to fix the bug and run the test again (it should pass).

• Indicating missing automated tests.

• Indicating if the team requires further training.
