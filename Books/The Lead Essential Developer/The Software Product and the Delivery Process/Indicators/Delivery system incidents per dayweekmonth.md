Tracking delivery system incidents per day, week, and month can reveal key insights about the stability of the deployment process and the impact of infrastructure maintenance on team productivity. By closely monitoring the occurrence and frequency of incidents—such as failed builds, pipeline breakdowns, and flaky test cases—teams can preemptively address issues before they disrupt workflows and impact deadlines.

### Key Benefits:
1. **Reliability Assessment**: Frequent incidents might signal that the delivery pipeline is becoming a bottleneck, requiring developer intervention and leading to delays.
2. **Proactivity**: With incident data, teams can proactively identify trends (e.g., increase in incidents at certain times or phases) and make necessary adjustments to ensure continuous, smooth operation.
3. **Investment in Improvements**: If the data suggests regular failures, it can make a case for investing time or resources in pipeline improvements—perhaps introducing more robust tests, optimizing configurations, or reducing dependencies prone to failure.

### Metrics to Track:
- **Daily Incident Rate**: Shows immediate stability; high daily rates could indicate an urgent need for fixes.
- **Weekly/Monthly Trends**: Useful for observing broader patterns, such as recurring issues in specific processes, or evaluating the impact of recent changes or updates in the pipeline.
  
### Actionable Insights:
If build failures occur too often, teams might need to:
- **Improve Test Coverage**: Ensure all critical pathways are covered, minimizing chances of unnoticed bugs.
- **Optimize Dependencies and Rules**: Eliminate fragile components or streamline dependency trees to reduce possible breakpoints.
- **Refine Monitoring and Alerts**: Immediate feedback can shorten the time to resolution and minimize the impact on the team.

By keeping track of this metric, a team can safeguard developer productivity and well-being while maintaining a high-quality delivery pipeline.
