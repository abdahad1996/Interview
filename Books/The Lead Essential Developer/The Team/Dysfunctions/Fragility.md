In simple terms:

A fragile tech team is one that easily breaks down under pressure and struggles to recover from problems. When such a team faces challenges or failures, it loses motivation and energy, making it even harder to bounce back the next time. This creates a cycle where issues keep piling up and morale drops, making the team less productive and effective over time.

In contrast, an *antifragile* team is the opposite. Inspired by Nassim Nicholas Taleb's concept from his book *Antifragile*, an antifragile team not only withstands stress but actually grows stronger from it. When they encounter problems, they don’t just “lose”; instead, they use the experience to learn, improve, and prepare for future challenges.

When fragility exists in a company, it affects the team. When the team is fragile, the quality of the code suffers. And poor code eventually harms the entire company. This cycle of fragility can trap teams and companies, so the goal is to help teams become antifragile—to ensure they can not only survive but thrive and get better with each challenge.
