The "test lines of code per production lines of code" metric is a way to assess the relative size and effort invested in the test suite compared to the actual code that drives the product (production code). Here’s a breakdown:

1. **Purpose**: Like code coverage metrics, this ratio provides insight into testing efforts but doesn’t give precise details on how much of the code is truly tested. It also doesn’t indicate the test approach (like TDD, where tests are written first). However, it does give an impression of the team’s commitment to testing.

2. **Trends in Code Ratios**:
   - **Higher Test Code than Production Code**: As a product evolves, test code might eventually exceed production code. This happens because for every condition in the production code (like `if`, `switch`, or `guard` statements), there should ideally be tests covering each possible path. Nested conditions increase this need further, leading to a rapid rise in test lines, often outpacing production code. This “combinatorial explosion” (the exponential growth in required tests) can sometimes be mitigated with better design practices, such as using polymorphism to reduce complex conditions.
   
   - **Lower Test Code than Production Code**: There may be scenarios where the test-to-production code ratio is low, especially if other testing strategies are used. For instance, the team might rely on UI testing techniques (like screenshot comparisons) or manual testing, particularly for user interface elements, rather than extensive unit testing. This choice will result in a lower amount of test code relative to production code.

3. **Key Takeaway**: This metric doesn’t tell the whole story but is useful as a general indicator of testing effort. A higher ratio signals substantial investment in testing, whereas a lower one might reflect reliance on alternative testing strategies or less comprehensive test coverage. 

**Good for**: Showing the overall effort and resources the team dedicates to testing.
