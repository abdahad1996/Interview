Tracking "lines of code per test file" is an effective way to gauge the complexity of your setup code and can highlight areas where dependencies and configuration setups may be excessive. If you notice a test file has many lines dedicated to setup, it can indicate that components are too tightly coupled, requiring more effort to mock or isolate each unit.

### Steps to implement the metric

1. **Collect Lines of Code (LOC) for Setup**: Identify specific setup sections in your test files. These typically include sections where dependencies are instantiated and configured, such as constructors, mock setups, or dependency injection.
2. **Track LOC for All Test Files**: Measure the LOC dedicated to setup across test files. You can use code analysis tools to automatically gather LOC for setup sections.
3. **Analyze Excessive Setup**:
   - Look for common patterns of high setup LOC across files. 
   - Components requiring concrete dependencies (e.g., component A needing component B) can reveal potential design issues like coupling.

### Interpretation

- **High LOC in Setup**: Excessive LOC here suggests components may not be following single-responsibility or dependency inversion principles, making them harder to isolate and test.
- **Improvements through Dependency Inversion**: Move toward interfaces or protocols to abstract dependencies, introducing test doubles or mocks. This setup reduces dependency on concrete classes in tests, simplifying configuration.

### Benefits

- **Identifying Design Smells**: Excess setup can be a sign of design issues, such as violations of single-responsibility or dependency inversion principles.
- **Encouraging Decoupling and Clean Design**: This metric encourages developers to design components with minimal external dependencies, resulting in cleaner, more modular code.

Tracking this metric over time can help monitor improvements in component design and the overall test setup simplification across your codebase.
