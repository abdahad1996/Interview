The concept here centers around managing **conditional statements**—code elements that create branches based on specific conditions (like `if-else` statements)—in a way that keeps an application’s architecture clean and maintainable over time.

Here’s a breakdown of the main points:

1. **Conditional Statements and State**:
   - When you use conditional statements, you’re indicating that parts of the application depend on certain states or conditions. For example, if a network is unavailable, the application might display a different UI or perform different actions.
   - While conditionals are often unavoidable, their **placement is key**. Scattering them across the app can lead to more complex and less maintainable code.

2. **Layered Architecture**:
   - In a well-layered system, different parts of the application (often termed layers, such as UI, business logic, and data) should have clear responsibilities. 
   - **Higher-Level Components** (e.g., controllers or managers) should manage most of the conditional logic, and **lower-level components** (e.g., views or individual modules) should act based on commands from the higher levels.
   
3. **Avoiding Redundant Checks**:
   - Placing conditionals in lower layers (like views) can lead to duplicated checks and scattered logic. For instance, if every UI component checks the network connection independently, you’d have multiple places in the code checking the same thing.
   - Instead, if you centralize the network check at a high level (e.g., in a single network manager or observer), then all views get the same status information without having to check themselves. This keeps the logic **consistent** and reduces redundant code.

4. **Code Health and Maintainability**:
   - By aiming to keep conditionals in fewer files, ideally in high-level components, you make the application easier to understand and maintain. Low-level components can remain "dumb," simply acting on commands they receive rather than making decisions.
   
5. **Assessment Goal**:
   - A key question to consider is: *Are conditionals spread across many files or concentrated in just a few?* The latter is preferred since it implies a centralized logic flow and lower-level simplicity, making the app less error-prone and easier to manage over time.

In summary, organizing conditional statements strategically—primarily in higher-level components—allows an application to handle states cleanly and keeps lower-level components simple and reusable.
