The **File Count per Merge** metric, as you described, offers insight into the batch size developers handle in each merge. High file counts typically indicate that developers are working with larger, more complex branches, which can:

1. **Slow Development and Release Cycles**: Large merges often take longer to review, test, and integrate, which slows down the pipeline.
2. **Cause Developer Fatigue**: Managing complex, large changes can lead to psychological fatigue, potentially resulting in burnout over time.
3. **Increase Costs**: Lengthier development cycles and complex merges often come with higher operational and opportunity costs for the firm.

This metric is valuable for:

- **Indicating Slowdowns in Operation Speed**: By monitoring this, teams can see when large merges are bogging down workflows.
- **Tracking Changes Over Time**: It allows teams to see if operational speeds improve or degrade over time.
- **Identifying Developer Struggles**: Persistent high counts may suggest that developers are facing challenges, such as working with overly complex or broad requirements.

For more context on the impact of larger batches, exploring the **Average Branch Lifetime** metric could help clarify how long these large branches stay open, further highlighting any bottlenecks.
