This guidance emphasizes creating **small, focused protocols** (or interfaces) with a minimal number of methods and properties to adhere to **good design principles** like the SOLID principles. Here’s a summary:

1. **Protocol Size as a Metric**:
   - Tracking the **number of methods and properties per protocol** can indicate whether protocols are small and specialized or large and general. Small, focused protocols tend to lead to more maintainable and flexible code.

2. **Principles Behind Small Protocols**:
   - **Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)**: This principle suggests splitting protocols so that implementing classes or structs aren’t forced to implement methods they don’t need.
   - **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)**: Small, specific protocols help ensure that derived classes can replace base classes without unexpected behavior, a goal aligned with the LSP.
   - **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**: Each protocol should ideally have only one responsibility. For example, a caching protocol might only handle adding and removing cache items, without unrelated methods mixed in.

3. **Advantages of Small Protocols**:
   - **Decoupling**: Smaller protocols reduce dependencies, making it easier to swap out implementations or create modular, reusable components.
   - **Reducing Complexity**: A protocol with fewer methods means fewer code paths, making the system simpler to understand and maintain.

4. **Practical Approach**:
   - Ideally, you should aim for **one method per protocol** where possible, but if multiple methods share a single responsibility, they can remain in one protocol.
   - If methods serve **different responsibilities**, consider separating them into distinct protocols to keep responsibilities isolated.

5. **Good Design Indicator**:
   - A low **method and property count per interface/protocol** suggests that the system is following good design practices, promoting cleaner abstractions and more manageable dependencies.

This approach leads to concise and reusable protocols, making the codebase easier to maintain, extend, and refactor.
