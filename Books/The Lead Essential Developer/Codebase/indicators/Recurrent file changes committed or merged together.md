Recurrent file changes committed or merged together can reveal hidden dependencies between components. When files frequently change together, particularly across modules that are intended to be decoupled, it indicates weak abstraction. Ideally, separate modules should interact without requiring simultaneous updates, which would signal a loose coupling.

For instance, if adding a new UI action consistently requires modifying the analytics module, even with an abstract interface in place, this suggests a tight coupling between the modules. Ideally, the system should allow new actions to be added to the UI without needing changes to analytics. This highlights the need for a more flexible abstraction where components communicate through interfaces that donâ€™t require direct cross-boundary updates.

Identifying these patterns of recurrent file changes is beneficial for:
- **Detecting weak abstractions**: Helps pinpoint areas where the design needs improvement to reduce coupling.
- **Improving modularity**: Guides adjustments in the codebase to create cleaner boundaries, enhancing long-term maintainability.
- **Optimizing team workflow**: Reduces the need for coordinated, cross-module commits, making it easier to manage code ownership and collaboration across teams.

This metric can lead to better software design by revealing structural issues that may otherwise remain hidden, ensuring that components remain cohesive and loosely coupled.
