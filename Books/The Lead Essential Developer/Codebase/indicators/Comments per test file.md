The “Comments per test file” metric serves as an insightful tool to maintain robust test coverage and to ensure no testing responsibilities are inadvertently skipped. It does more than measure comment frequency; it helps identify areas in testing that may not be receiving adequate attention.

### Key Principles:
1. **Highlighting Untested Behavior:** Commented-out code in test files should be scrutinized closely, as it could indicate missing test coverage. These comments act as reminders or placeholders for functionality that has not been fully verified. Each commented-out test can serve as an indication of potentially untested behavior, which may compromise the integrity of the software if left unchecked.

2. **Tracking Issues Outside of Formal Project Tools:** Comments can indicate tech debt or areas needing further attention. When a test is deferred or not implemented, it’s often due to external pressures like deadlines. However, these pending tasks may not be logged in formal project management tools, making them invisible to the wider team. Therefore, regular examination of comments in test files can help uncover hidden issues or technical debt that might otherwise go unnoticed.

3. **Encouraging Comprehensive Testing:** By maintaining a low rate of commented-out tests, teams ensure that they’re not deferring critical verifications. This promotes a culture where automated checks are prioritized, which can ultimately decrease the likelihood of releasing faulty or incomplete features to users.

### Use Cases:
- **Indicating Potentially Untested Behavior:** This metric is beneficial for flagging untested features or edge cases that were commented out and could lead to incomplete verification.
- **Highlighting Issues Outside of Shared Management Tools:** As deadlines approach, tests that are commented out and deferred are often missed in shared management tools, making this metric useful for surfacing work that may otherwise remain invisible to the broader team.

By focusing on this metric, teams can better adhere to thorough testing practices, reduce technical debt, and maintain higher product quality, ultimately benefiting the user experience.
