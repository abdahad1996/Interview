Code coverage is indeed a valuable metric, as it reveals the percentage of code that is exercised by automated tests. However, it’s essential to keep in mind that while high coverage implies that tests are written alongside production code, it doesn't necessarily mean that all edge cases or potential bugs are caught—only that those specific lines of code were executed. Missing assertions, untested logic paths, or uncovered edge cases can still be present.

High code coverage is beneficial, but as you noted, it doesn't eliminate the possibility of programmer mistakes. It’s also worth noting that striving for 100% coverage isn't always practical or necessary; instead, teams should focus on meaningful coverage, especially for critical paths and business logic.

Low or zero coverage can sometimes suggest that the team is not investing in automated testing, which could lead to increased risk of undetected bugs in production. 

In practice, code coverage is especially helpful for:
- Identifying untested or risky areas in the codebase.
- Guiding developers to focus on areas that need tests.
- Assessing testing practices and consistency within the team. 

While code coverage is a useful metric, it’s best used in combination with other testing quality metrics and practices, such as mutation testing, to ensure robustness beyond just code execution.
