Boolean flags as parameters or properties within modules or components can indeed be an indicator of excessive internal state management, which often hints at increased complexity. This complexity can make code harder to maintain, understand, and test. Excessive use of Boolean flags can lead to "flag arguments" or conditionally managed states, which may signal that the module or component is handling too much responsibility.

### Why Overusing Boolean Flags Can Be Problematic

1. **Increased Complexity**: Components with multiple Boolean flags often have more branches and conditional logic, which can lead to a complex and hard-to-read flow.
2. **Reduced Reusability**: When a component is highly dependent on specific Boolean configurations, it may become more difficult to reuse in other contexts.
3. **Testing Challenges**: Testing becomes more challenging as the number of possible flag combinations increases. More combinations require more test cases, making comprehensive testing difficult.
4. **Responsibility Overload**: A component with many flags may be managing multiple responsibilities, which can violate the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) and lead to tightly coupled code.

### Best Practices

1. **Move Conditions Higher**: When possible, move conditional logic to a higher-level component. This can reduce the internal complexity of lower-level components, delegating state management to more appropriate layers.
   
2. **Refactor into Smaller Components**: If a component has multiple Boolean flags that control distinct behavior, consider refactoring it into smaller, focused components that each manage a single piece of logic.

3. **Consider State Machines**: Instead of relying on Boolean flags, a state machine can often manage complex states more cleanly and provide a clearer, more maintainable structure for state transitions.

4. **Use Descriptive Properties**: If flags are unavoidable, use descriptive naming to make the componentâ€™s logic more readable and meaningful.
