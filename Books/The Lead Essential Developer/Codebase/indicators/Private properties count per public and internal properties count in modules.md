This metric is valuable in assessing module encapsulation by quantifying how much internal data is exposed, thus impacting modularity and extensibility. By counting private properties relative to public and internal properties, you can identify if components are leaking implementation details or overly coupling with others. This overexposure can lead to complex interdependencies, where modules are tightly coupled to specific details of other modules, making future changes challenging and risking cascading issues if details change.

### Steps to Apply the Metric

1. **Define Property Scope**:
   - **Private**: Encapsulates data within the module/class, inaccessible outside.
   - **Internal**: Accessible within the module but hidden from other modules.
   - **Public**: Exposed outside the module, usable by external systems.

2. **Calculate Percentages**:
   - For each component, count:
     - The total number of properties.
     - The count of private properties.
     - The count of public and internal properties.

3. **Interpret the Results**:
   - High percentages of private properties suggest good encapsulation, keeping implementation details hidden.
   - Higher proportions of public/internal properties may signal a risk of unnecessary exposure, possibly increasing coupling and reducing modularity.

### Ideal Usage Scenarios

- **Code Reviews and Refactoring**: Helps identify modules that might need access-level adjustments.
- **System Design**: Assists in structuring new components to maintain strict boundaries, reducing dependencies.
  
As a best practice, default to private access and open it up to internal or public only if a legitimate reason for exposure exists, helping maintain a clean, modular architecture.
