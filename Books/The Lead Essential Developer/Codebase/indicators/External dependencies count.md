The concept you're outlining emphasizes the importance of cautiously managing external dependencies in a project. Large numbers of dependencies can introduce substantial risks, including:

- **Design Constraints**: External dependencies might force specific architectures or structures, which can conflict with the system's design needs.
- **Runtime Stability Risks**: Dependencies could introduce hard-to-debug crashes.
- **Security and Legal Issues**: Security vulnerabilities in dependencies may affect the whole system, and licensing issues can create legal problems.
- **Evolution and Compatibility**: Updates in dependencies may not align with the project's timeline, affecting the product roadmap negatively.

To manage these risks, consider the following:

1. **Quality Assessment**: Evaluate the quality assurance practices of the dependency. Look for responsiveness in issue resolution, compatibility with platform updates, support SLAs, and frequency of releases. For open-source libraries, assess commit and merge frequency.

2. **Testing Depth**: Look at code coverage, test time per commit, setup code for test files, and comments. Metrics like lines of code per file and conditional statements per test file provide insight into the code's maintainability and potential for bugs.

3. **Reducing Dependency Count**: Many common dependencies are unsuitable for complex projects, requiring significant time and money investments. Assess whether simpler, custom solutions could replace certain dependencies, reducing reliance on external libraries.

4. **Dependency Inversion**: To protect your system, create an abstraction layer between third-party dependencies and your code. This allows you to switch dependencies without affecting your core codebase, maintaining modularity and future-proofing against potential disruptions from outdated or unsupported dependencies.

This approach helps identify and manage the risk exposure in your codebase and roadmap effectively.
