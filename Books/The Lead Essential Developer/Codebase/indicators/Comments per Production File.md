This metric, "Comments per Production File," evaluates the extent of in-code annotations like "TODO," "FIX," and similar notes. A high metric value can indicate over-reliance on such comments, which may divert attention from established project management tools (e.g., GitHub issues, JIRA). While these comments may appear helpful, they risk creating fragmented or outdated records of needed work or technical debt, reducing transparency across the team. Instead, all pending tasks, enhancements, and tech debt should be tracked in a centralized, universally accessible tool, which serves as the single source of truth.

In a well-organized codebase, comments should focus on clarifying complex logic or providing insight into why certain implementations are used. Ideally, actionable annotations (e.g., reminders or TODOs) should be minimal or absent, as they signal work items that would be better managed in a project tool. This approach ensures better visibility and encourages teams to manage tasks and technical debt consistently and transparently.

**Value of this Metric:**  
- It identifies tech debt or incomplete work that may not be fully visible to the team.
- Ensures that all actionable work items are managed and tracked in a shared platform.
- Promotes clear, concise, and focused code by reducing clutter from redundant or temporary comments.
