You're absolutely right; keeping code quality high is all about vigilance and thoughtful maintenance. Small shortcuts can accumulate and snowball into significant issues over time, embedding bad practices that make the codebase more fragile and difficult to work with. Indicators are invaluable because they provide objective insights that help teams stay proactive instead of reactive. By automating these metrics, teams can keep an eye on the state of the codebase and identify problem areas early, preventing unnecessary technical debt from piling up.

Metrics like code complexity, test coverage, bug density, code churn, and coupling/cohesion indexes are just a few examples of indicators that, if tracked over time, can give a snapshot of the codeâ€™s health. Automated notifications and trend analysis further enhance the usefulness, alerting teams to unfavorable patterns before they become full-fledged issues. In this way, teams can uphold best practices and make more informed decisions aligned with long-term sustainability, ultimately safeguarding not just the product but also team morale and productivity. 

Have you considered which specific indicators you'd like to start with for your own codebase, or would you like suggestions on tools for automating this kind of monitoring?
