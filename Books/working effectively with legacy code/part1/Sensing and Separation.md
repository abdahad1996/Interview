Sure, let’s explore the concepts of **sensing**, **separation**, and **faking collaborators** using examples in Swift. This version will focus on how these testing strategies apply in Swift, particularly using protocols and mock objects.

### 1. **Sensing and Separation**:

In testing, especially when working with classes that have dependencies, two primary challenges often arise:

- **Sensing**: This occurs when you want to observe or verify what a class does internally, but the class’s design doesn’t easily expose this information.
- **Separation**: This happens when a class cannot be tested in isolation due to its dependencies on other components, making it hard to run it in a test environment without involving those dependencies.

### Example of Sensing and Separation:
Imagine a class called `NetworkBridge` in a network management system:

```swift
class NetworkBridge {
    private var endpoints: [EndPoint]

    init(endpoints: [EndPoint]) {
        self.endpoints = endpoints
    }

    func formRouting(sourceID: String, destID: String) {
        // Configures routing between endpoints.
        // For example, it might interact with hardware here.
    }
}
```

- **Sensing Issue**: The `formRouting` method might change the state of `EndPoint` objects or interact with hardware. To test it, we’d want to verify that routing was set up correctly, but `NetworkBridge` might not provide direct access to this information.
- **Separation Issue**: If `NetworkBridge` requires real `EndPoint` objects that interact with actual hardware, testing in isolation becomes difficult. We may not always have access to hardware, and simulating a network environment is complex.

### 2. **Faking Collaborators**:

To address these issues in Swift, we use **protocols** and **mock objects**. A protocol can define the interface for the dependencies, allowing us to create **fake objects** that simulate real objects during testing.

### Example of Faking a Collaborator in Swift:

Consider a point-of-sale (POS) system with a `Sale` class that interacts with a `Display`:

1. **Without a Fake Object**:
   - The `Sale` class directly updates a hardware display when an item is scanned:

```swift
protocol Display {
    func showLine(_ line: String)
}

class Sale {
    private var display: Display

    init(display: Display) {
        self.display = display
    }

    func scan(barcode: String) {
        // Normally, it would look up the item using the barcode.
        let itemLine = "Milk $3.99" // Simulated result.
        display.showLine(itemLine)
    }
}
```

In this design, the `Sale` class depends on a `Display` to show messages, but we don't have to interact directly with hardware.

2. **Introducing a Fake Object**:
   - Instead of using a real `Display` that interacts with hardware, we create a `FakeDisplay` for testing:

```swift
class FakeDisplay: Display {
    private(set) var lastLine: String?

    func showLine(_ line: String) {
        lastLine = line // Capture the displayed line for verification.
    }
}
```

3. **Writing a Test with the Fake**:
   - Using `FakeDisplay`, we can test the `Sale` class without needing access to real hardware:

```swift
import XCTest

class SaleTests: XCTestCase {
    func testDisplayAnItem() {
        let display = FakeDisplay()
        let sale = Sale(display: display)

        sale.scan(barcode: "1")

        XCTAssertEqual(display.lastLine, "Milk $3.99")
    }
}
```

- **Explanation**:
  - In this test, `FakeDisplay` replaces a real display.
  - The `scan` method simulates scanning an item, which results in a call to `display.showLine()`.
  - `FakeDisplay` records the last line displayed instead of sending it to real hardware.
  - The test then checks if the captured line matches the expected output, verifying that the `Sale` class correctly interacts with the display.

### 3. **Mock Objects**:

A **mock object** is a more advanced type of fake object that not only simulates behavior but also allows us to set expectations and verify interactions.

- **Purpose of Mocks**: 
  - Mocks allow us to automatically verify that certain interactions (like method calls) happen as expected during a test.

### Example of a Mock Object in Swift:

Let's extend the previous example by creating a mock display using a simple approach, suitable for Swift:

```swift
class MockDisplay: Display {
    private var expectedLine: String?
    private(set) var wasShowLineCalledCorrectly = false

    func expectShowLine(_ line: String) {
        expectedLine = line
    }

    func showLine(_ line: String) {
        if line == expectedLine {
            wasShowLineCalledCorrectly = true
        }
    }

    func verify() {
        XCTAssertTrue(wasShowLineCalledCorrectly, "Expected showLine to be called with \(expectedLine ?? "nil"), but it wasn't.")
    }
}
```

- **Using the Mock in a Test**:

```swift
class SaleTests: XCTestCase {
    func testDisplayAnItem() {
        let mockDisplay = MockDisplay()
        mockDisplay.expectShowLine("Milk $3.99")

        let sale = Sale(display: mockDisplay)
        sale.scan(barcode: "1")

        mockDisplay.verify()
    }
}
```

- **Explanation**:
  - `MockDisplay` sets an expectation for what should be displayed: `"Milk $3.99"`.
  - When `scan()` is called on the `Sale` object, it triggers `showLine()`.
  - After the method call, `verify()` is used to check if `showLine()` was called with the expected argument.
  - If the expected method call did not occur, the test fails, providing automatic validation of the interaction.

### **Theoretical Insights**:

1. **Sensing** helps verify the effects of a class’s actions by using a fake or mock object to capture and inspect the outputs that would be sent to other parts of the system.
2. **Separation** allows testing a class in isolation by replacing its dependencies with simpler versions, such as fakes or mocks. This is especially useful when the real dependencies require complex setup or external resources.
3. **Fake Objects** are simpler to implement and focus on capturing the output for manual verification, while **Mock Objects** can automatically validate that expected interactions took place, providing a more structured approach to testing.
4. Using protocols in Swift makes it easier to replace real objects with fakes or mocks, enabling developers to isolate and test individual components effectively. This approach is particularly valuable for testing legacy code that wasn’t designed with testing in mind.

### Summary:
By using protocols and fake objects like `FakeDisplay` or more advanced mocks like `MockDisplay`, you can write tests that ensure the behavior of your classes without needing to depend on complex or unavailable resources (like network hardware or databases). This allows you to verify your code’s behavior quickly and effectively, making development and debugging more efficient while enabling safer refactoring. This testing approach is particularly beneficial when dealing with legacy code, allowing developers to incrementally test and improve the codebase.
