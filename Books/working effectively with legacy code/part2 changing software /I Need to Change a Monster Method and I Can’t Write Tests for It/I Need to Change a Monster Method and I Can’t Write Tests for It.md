Refactoring a "monster method" can be a daunting task, especially when tests are missing, and the risk of introducing bugs is high. Let’s break down the various strategies and techniques with a deeper dive, including Swift examples that illustrate how each method can be applied effectively.

### 1. **What is a Monster Method?**
A *monster method* refers to a function that has grown to be very long and complicated. This kind of method often has many responsibilities, is difficult to understand, and even harder to change without breaking something. When you encounter a monster method, it can be very challenging to know where to start refactoring it.

- **Why is it problematic?**
  - Hard to understand: The longer the method, the harder it is to grasp what it's doing at a glance.
  - Difficult to test: Testing such a large chunk of functionality is tough because of all the different paths and conditions it might have.
  - High risk of introducing bugs: Any change to a monster method can potentially affect many behaviors, making it easy to introduce bugs.

### 2. **Varieties of Monster Methods**
   - **Bulleted Methods**: These methods resemble a list of sequential tasks without much nesting. They might not look too bad at first, but their long length can hide dependencies between various steps.

   - **Snarled Methods**: These methods have heavy nesting of loops, conditionals, or complex logic. The heavy use of indentation makes them more challenging to refactor because of the tightly coupled logic.

   **Example in Swift**:
   ```swift
   // Example of a Bulleted Method in Swift
   func processReservation() {
       calculateInitialCost()
       if userIsVIP {
           applyVIPDiscount()
       }
       checkRoomAvailability()
       makeReservation()
       sendConfirmationEmail()
   }

   // Example of a Snarled Method in Swift
   func processReservation() {
       if userIsVIP {
           if checkRoomAvailability() {
               applyVIPDiscount()
               makeReservation()
               if emailEnabled {
                   sendConfirmationEmail()
               }
           } else {
               print("Room not available")
           }
       } else {
           if checkRoomAvailability() {
               makeReservation()
           } else {
               print("Room not available")
           }
       }
   }
   ```
   The bulleted method is easier to read, while the snarled method has nested logic that’s harder to track.

### 3. **Sprout Method and Sprout Class**
These techniques involve breaking a small piece of the method into its own method or class, which helps isolate functionality and reduce the size of the original method.

- **Sprout Method**: Extract a piece of logic from a large method into a new method.
- **Sprout Class**: If the logic involves a distinct responsibility, consider moving it into a new class.

   **Example in Swift**:
   ```swift
   // Original Monster Method
   func processOrder(order: Order) {
       if order.items.isEmpty {
           notifyEmptyOrder()
       } else {
           for item in order.items {
               if item.isAvailable {
                   applyDiscountIfEligible(item)
                   processItem(item)
               } else {
                   notifyItemUnavailable(item)
               }
           }
       }
   }

   // Sprout Method: Extract processItem
   func processOrder(order: Order) {
       if order.items.isEmpty {
           notifyEmptyOrder()
       } else {
           for item in order.items {
               processItem(item)
           }
       }
   }

   func processItem(_ item: Item) {
       if item.isAvailable {
           applyDiscountIfEligible(item)
           // Logic for processing an item
       } else {
           notifyItemUnavailable(item)
       }
   }
   ```

   By using the **Sprout Method**, we isolate the logic for processing each item, making the `processOrder` method shorter and easier to understand.

### 4. **Tackling Monster Methods with Automated Refactoring Tools**
Automated refactoring tools like Xcode's refactoring support can help you safely extract methods without manually copying and pasting code. These tools analyze the code for dependencies and ensure that the extraction is safe.

   - **Example in Swift using Xcode’s Extract Method**:
     Suppose you want to extract a part of a function. Highlight the code block, right-click, and choose *Refactor > Extract to Method*. Xcode will create a new method with the selected code.

   **Example:**
   ```swift
   // Before using the tool
   func calculateOrder(order: Order) {
       let basePrice = order.items.reduce(0) { $0 + $1.price }
       let discount = basePrice * 0.1
       let totalPrice = basePrice - discount
       print("Total price: \(totalPrice)")
   }

   // After using Xcode's Extract Method feature
   func calculateOrder(order: Order) {
       let basePrice = calculateBasePrice(order: order)
       let discount = basePrice * 0.1
       let totalPrice = basePrice - discount
       print("Total price: \(totalPrice)")
   }

   private func calculateBasePrice(order: Order) -> Double {
       return order.items.reduce(0) { $0 + $1.price }
   }
   ```

### 5. **Manual Refactoring Challenge**
Without automated tools, manual refactoring requires extra caution. Techniques like **Introduce Sensing Variables** or **Extract What You Know** help reduce the risks of breaking code.

   - **Introduce Sensing Variables**: Add temporary variables to track state changes during refactoring, which helps ensure behavior remains unchanged.

   **Example in Swift**:
   ```swift
   class OrderProcessor {
       private var isItemProcessed = false

       func processOrder(order: Order) {
           for item in order.items {
               processItem(item)
               isItemProcessed = true // Sensing variable
           }
       }

       func processItem(_ item: Item) {
           // Complex logic for processing an item
       }
   }

   // Later, we write tests to verify that `isItemProcessed` becomes `true` when items are processed.
   ```

### 6. **Extract Small Pieces**
Instead of trying to extract large chunks, start with small, self-contained parts of the method. Focus on sections with few dependencies to reduce the risk of errors.

   **Example in Swift**:
   ```swift
   // Original method
   func calculateTotal(items: [Item]) -> Double {
       var total = 0.0
       for item in items {
           total += item.price
       }
       return total
   }

   // Extracted method for calculating the sum of item prices
   func calculateTotal(items: [Item]) -> Double {
       return sumPrices(of: items)
   }

   private func sumPrices(of items: [Item]) -> Double {
       return items.reduce(0.0) { $0 + $1.price }
   }
   ```

   By starting with the extraction of `sumPrices`, you can focus on testing and verifying a smaller unit of functionality.

### 7. **Break Out a Method Object**
When a method is too complex and tightly coupled with many temporary variables, creating a new class can be the solution. This class is responsible for handling the logic of the original method.

   **Example in Swift**:
   ```swift
   class ReservationProcessor {
       private let reservation: Reservation

       init(reservation: Reservation) {
           self.reservation = reservation
       }

       func process() {
           checkAvailability()
           applyDiscounts()
           finalizeReservation()
       }

       private func checkAvailability() {
           // Logic to check room availability
       }

       private func applyDiscounts() {
           // Logic to apply discounts if applicable
       }

       private func finalizeReservation() {
           // Final reservation steps
       }
   }

   // Using the new class in a more concise way
   let processor = ReservationProcessor(reservation: myReservation)
   processor.process()
   ```

   This technique not only simplifies the original class but also isolates the logic into a new class, making it easier to understand and test.

### 8. **Skeletonizing Methods vs. Finding Sequences**
   - **Skeletonizing**: Extract logic and condition checks into separate methods to leave behind a "skeleton" of the original logic.
   - **Finding Sequences**: Identify sequences of operations that can be grouped together into a method.

   **Example in Swift**:
   ```swift
   // Skeletonizing example
   func updateStatus() {
       if shouldUpgrade() {
           upgradeStatus()
       }
   }

   private func shouldUpgrade() -> Bool {
       return userPoints > 1000
   }

   private func upgradeStatus() {
       userLevel += 1
   }

   // Finding sequences example
   func updateOrderStatus(order: Order) {
       if canUpdateOrder(order) {
           applyUpdatesToOrder(order)
       }
   }

   private func canUpdateOrder(_ order: Order) -> Bool {
       return order.status == .pending && order.items.isNotEmpty
   }

   private func applyUpdatesToOrder(_ order: Order) {
       // Detailed update logic
   }
   ```

### 9. **Extract to the Current Class First**
Extracting methods within the current class before moving them elsewhere helps maintain stability during refactoring. This allows you to explore the effects of changes before deciding to move a method to another class.

### 10. **Be Prepared to Redo Extractions**
Refactoring is iterative. As you break down methods, you may discover better ways to reorganize the logic. Don’t hesitate to adjust your approach if a better design pattern becomes apparent.

   **Example in Swift**:
   ```swift
   // Initial extraction
   func calculateDiscountedPrice(item: Item) -> Double {
       return item.price * (1 - discountRate)


   }

   // Later realization that discount should depend on user type
   func calculateDiscountedPrice(item: Item, user: User) -> Double {
       let rate = user.isVIP ? 0.2 : 0.1
       return item.price * (1 - rate)
   }
   ```

   This adjustment might require undoing some earlier work, but it results in a more accurate design.

By using these techniques, you can safely refactor monster methods into smaller, more manageable pieces while minimizing the risks of introducing bugs. Each step contributes to cleaner, more testable code, making future changes easier to manage.
