The scenario you’ve described involves making changes to a legacy codebase where testing can be challenging due to tight coupling and dependencies between classes. When you need to change or add new features to multiple interconnected classes, testing each one separately can become time-consuming and cumbersome. Here’s a breakdown of the issue, the strategy of testing one level back, and how it can be applied with examples in Swift.

### The Problem: Closely Scattered Changes

In a legacy codebase, adding a new feature often requires modifying several closely related classes. For example, you might find yourself needing to change three or four classes, each of which is tightly coupled to others. This means you can’t easily write unit tests for one class without addressing the dependencies it has on other classes. In such cases, the time and effort to get each class under test might discourage you from writing tests altogether.

**Example Scenario**: Imagine a billing system where you need to change the way shipping costs are calculated. You find that:

- The `Invoice` class calculates the shipping costs using a method called `getValue()`.
- The `BillingStatement` class relies on `Invoice.getValue()` for generating billing statements.
- The constructor of `Invoice` also needs to be modified to introduce a new `ShippingPricer` class.

To get the `Invoice` class under test, you’d have to address the dependencies in `BillingStatement` and potentially modify the `ShippingPricer`. This could take hours for each class.

### The Solution: Testing One Level Back

Rather than trying to unit-test each class individually, you can look for a **higher-level interception point** where you can write tests that cover the changes you need to make across multiple classes. This approach allows you to:

- Write tests at a single point, such as a public method or an interface, to cover changes in multiple private methods or tightly coupled classes.
- Gain “test coverage” for refactoring efforts without having to fully decouple and isolate every class initially.

### What is an Interception Point?

An **interception point** is a place in the code where you can observe the effects of changes in other parts of the code. By writing tests at an interception point, you can verify the combined behavior of several classes without needing to write tests for each individual class.

- **Pinch Points**: A **pinch point** is a type of interception point where many changes funnel through a single method or point of interaction. It’s an ideal spot for testing because it can detect changes across multiple classes.

### Example in Swift

Let’s consider a simplified example using Swift where we need to refactor an `Invoice` class and introduce a new `ShippingPricer` class. We’ll see how to identify a good interception point and write tests for it.

**Initial Classes Before Refactoring:**

```swift
import Foundation

class Invoice {
    private var items: [Double]
    private var billingDate: Date
    private var originatorState: String

    init(items: [Double], billingDate: Date, originatorState: String) {
        self.items = items
        self.billingDate = billingDate
        self.originatorState = originatorState
    }

    func getValue() -> Double {
        var total = items.reduce(0, +)
        if billingDate > Calendar.current.date(byAdding: .year, value: 1, to: Date())! {
            total += originatorState == "NY" ? 10.0 : 5.0 // Simplified shipping logic
        }
        total += getTax()
        return total
    }

    private func getTax() -> Double {
        return items.reduce(0, +) * 0.08
    }
}

class BillingStatement {
    private var invoices: [Invoice] = []

    func addInvoice(_ invoice: Invoice) {
        invoices.append(invoice)
    }

    func makeStatement() -> Double {
        return invoices.map { $0.getValue() }.reduce(0, +)
    }
}
```

Here, `BillingStatement` relies on `Invoice.getValue()`, which includes the logic for calculating shipping costs for different states.

### Refactoring for `ShippingPricer`

Suppose we need to extract the shipping calculation logic into a separate `ShippingPricer` class:

```swift
class ShippingPricer {
    func getPrice(forState state: String, billingDate: Date) -> Double {
        if state == "NY" {
            return 10.0 // New York has a special rate
        }
        return 5.0
    }
}

class Invoice {
    private var items: [Double]
    private var billingDate: Date
    private var originatorState: String
    private var shippingPricer: ShippingPricer

    init(items: [Double], billingDate: Date, originatorState: String, shippingPricer: ShippingPricer) {
        self.items = items
        self.billingDate = billingDate
        self.originatorState = originatorState
        self.shippingPricer = shippingPricer
    }

    func getValue() -> Double {
        var total = items.reduce(0, +)
        total += shippingPricer.getPrice(forState: originatorState, billingDate: billingDate)
        total += getTax()
        return total
    }

    private func getTax() -> Double {
        return items.reduce(0, +) * 0.08
    }
}
```

Now, `Invoice` uses `ShippingPricer` to calculate shipping costs, making the logic more modular.

### Finding an Interception Point

- We could write unit tests for `ShippingPricer` to verify its behavior.
- However, since `ShippingPricer` is tightly integrated into `Invoice.getValue()`, it might be more efficient to write tests directly at the `getValue()` method.
- We could also write tests at `BillingStatement.makeStatement()` to verify the overall behavior of the billing system.

### Writing Tests at the Interception Point

**Test Case for `Invoice.getValue()`**:

```swift
import XCTest

class InvoiceTests: XCTestCase {
    func testInvoiceWithNYShipping() {
        let pricer = ShippingPricer()
        let invoice = Invoice(
            items: [100.0, 200.0],
            billingDate: Date(),
            originatorState: "NY",
            shippingPricer: pricer
        )
        let value = invoice.getValue()
        XCTAssertEqual(value, 310.0 + 10.0 + 24.0) // 310 is item total, 10 is shipping for NY, 24 is tax (8%)
    }
    
    func testInvoiceWithDefaultShipping() {
        let pricer = ShippingPricer()
        let invoice = Invoice(
            items: [100.0, 200.0],
            billingDate: Date(),
            originatorState: "CA",
            shippingPricer: pricer
        )
        let value = invoice.getValue()
        XCTAssertEqual(value, 310.0 + 5.0 + 24.0) // 310 is item total, 5 is default shipping, 24 is tax (8%)
    }
}
```

By writing tests at `Invoice.getValue()`, we verify the behavior of `ShippingPricer` in combination with `Invoice`.

**Test Case for `BillingStatement.makeStatement()`**:

```swift
class BillingStatementTests: XCTestCase {
    func testBillingStatementWithMultipleInvoices() {
        let pricer = ShippingPricer()
        let invoice1 = Invoice(
            items: [100.0, 200.0],
            billingDate: Date(),
            originatorState: "NY",
            shippingPricer: pricer
        )
        let invoice2 = Invoice(
            items: [150.0],
            billingDate: Date(),
            originatorState: "CA",
            shippingPricer: pricer
        )
        let statement = BillingStatement()
        statement.addInvoice(invoice1)
        statement.addInvoice(invoice2)
        
        let total = statement.makeStatement()
        XCTAssertEqual(total, 334.0 + 183.0) // Includes item totals, tax, and shipping
    }
}
```

By testing at `BillingStatement.makeStatement()`, we cover changes in both `Invoice` and `ShippingPricer`.

### Summary

- **Interception Points** like `Invoice.getValue()` or `BillingStatement.makeStatement()` allow you to verify the combined behavior of tightly coupled classes without testing each one separately.
- **Pinch Points** like `BillingStatement.makeStatement()` cover changes in a broader set of classes and make refactoring safer.
- **Higher-Level Tests**: These tests can act as a bridge to eventually writing more granular unit tests for individual classes if needed.

This approach helps you keep the codebase stable during refactoring while avoiding the overhead of breaking all dependencies at once.

Let's break down the concepts of pinch points, effect sketches, and unit test strategies with examples in Swift, translating them from the original Java-based context.

### Understanding Pinch Points in Swift

**What is a Pinch Point?**

A pinch point is a place in your code that acts as a "natural encapsulation boundary." It serves as a narrow funnel where the effects of a larger piece of code converge, making it a focal point for testing and debugging. When you find a pinch point, you’ve essentially identified where most of the interactions in a specific area of the code occur.

For instance, consider the following Swift class that deals with generating a billing statement:

```swift
class BillingStatement {
    func makeStatement(for invoices: [Invoice], items: [Item]) -> Statement {
        // Logic to create a statement from invoices and items
    }
}
```

In this example:
- The `makeStatement` method is a **pinch point**. It serves as the main interaction point between `BillingStatement` and the `invoices` and `items` data.
- If something goes wrong with the statement creation, we would primarily look at the `BillingStatement` class, and possibly the `invoices` and `items` data, to diagnose the issue.

The benefit of such a design is that we don’t need to understand the internal workings of `invoices` and `items` to call `makeStatement`—we only need to provide the required data. This aligns with the concept of encapsulation: hiding the details but making sure that the interaction boundary is clear.

### Using Effect Sketches to Find Hidden Classes

**What is an Effect Sketch?**

An effect sketch is a tool to visualize the dependencies within a class and identify potential boundaries where responsibilities can be split into different classes. It helps you see which parts of a class directly depend on each other and which don't, guiding class extractions.

**Example: Simplifying a Parser Class**

Suppose we have a parser class in Swift that deals with parsing an expression:

```swift
class Parser {
    private var root: Node?
    private var currentPosition: Int = 0
    private var stringToParse: String = ""
    
    func parseExpression(_ expression: String) {
        // Parsing logic
    }
    
    private func getToken() -> Token {
        // Logic to get the next token
    }
    
    private func hasMoreTokens() -> Bool {
        // Logic to check if there are more tokens
    }
}
```

In this class:
- `parseExpression` relies on `getToken` and `hasMoreTokens` to do its work.
- `getToken` and `hasMoreTokens` depend on `stringToParse` and `currentPosition`, but `parseExpression` doesn't need to know about those directly.

From an **effect sketch**, we can see that there's a natural encapsulation boundary: `getToken` and `hasMoreTokens` are related to tokenizing the input, while `parseExpression` deals with the overall parsing logic. This suggests that we can extract the token-related logic into a new class, `Tokenizer`, like this:

```swift
class Tokenizer {
    private var currentPosition: Int = 0
    private var stringToParse: String
    
    init(stringToParse: String) {
        self.stringToParse = stringToParse
    }
    
    func getToken() -> Token {
        // Logic to get the next token
    }
    
    func hasMoreTokens() -> Bool {
        // Logic to check if there are more tokens
    }
}

class Parser {
    private var root: Node?
    private var tokenizer: Tokenizer
    
    init(tokenizer: Tokenizer) {
        self.tokenizer = tokenizer
    }
    
    func parseExpression() {
        // Parsing logic using tokenizer
    }
}
```

Now, the responsibilities are more clearly divided:
- `Tokenizer` handles the tokenization.
- `Parser` uses `Tokenizer` to parse expressions.

This approach simplifies the design and makes each class more focused on a single responsibility.

### Writing Tests at Pinch Points

**Using Pinch Points for Testing**

Pinch points are ideal places to focus your testing efforts because they represent key interaction points in your code. When you test a pinch point, you ensure that a critical piece of your application's logic behaves correctly. This allows you to refactor with confidence.

**Example in Swift**

Let's say you have the `BillingStatement` class from earlier:

```swift
class BillingStatement {
    func makeStatement(for invoices: [Invoice], items: [Item]) -> Statement {
        // Logic to create a statement from invoices and items
    }
}
```

We can write a unit test directly targeting the `makeStatement` method:

```swift
import XCTest

class BillingStatementTests: XCTestCase {
    func testMakeStatement() {
        let billingStatement = BillingStatement()
        let invoices = [/* Test data */]
        let items = [/* Test data */]
        
        let statement = billingStatement.makeStatement(for: invoices, items: items)
        
        // Assert that the statement is as expected
        XCTAssertEqual(statement.totalAmount, 100.0)
        // Add more assertions for other parts of the statement
    }
}
```

Here, `makeStatement` is the pinch point where we check that the logic for creating a statement behaves as expected with given inputs. This test ensures that as long as `makeStatement` is tested thoroughly, we don’t need to worry as much about the internals of how `invoices` and `items` are structured.

### Avoiding Pinch Point Traps

When writing tests, it's important to avoid making unit tests too broad. If you find that your tests require too many collaborators to instantiate, it might be a sign to split your classes into smaller, more manageable pieces.

For example, instead of writing a test that depends on a full `Parser` and `Tokenizer`, we might write isolated tests for `Tokenizer`:

```swift
class TokenizerTests: XCTestCase {
    func testGetToken() {
        let tokenizer = Tokenizer(stringToParse: "123 + 456")
        let token = tokenizer.getToken()
        
        XCTAssertEqual(token.value, "123")
    }
    
    func testHasMoreTokens() {
        let tokenizer = Tokenizer(stringToParse: "123 + 456")
        XCTAssertTrue(tokenizer.hasMoreTokens())
    }
}
```

This way, we can test `Tokenizer` and `Parser` separately, making the tests faster and easier to maintain. Over time, if the tests for `Tokenizer` and `Parser` become robust, we might even remove some of the broader tests at the pinch points.

### Summary

- **Pinch Points**: These are key encapsulation points that help isolate parts of the code for testing and debugging.
- **Effect Sketches**: Use them to identify where to split responsibilities in large classes.
- **Testing Strategies**: Focus on writing unit tests at pinch points, but avoid letting those tests become mini-integration tests. Use isolated testing when possible to ensure a clear separation of concerns.

By applying these principles, you can make your Swift codebase more modular, testable, and easier to understand.
