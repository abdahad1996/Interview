### Problem Overview: Effect Propagation and Simplifying Effect Sketches

When modifying or testing existing code, especially in large or legacy systems, it’s important to understand how changes will affect other parts of the codebase. This is known as **effect propagation**. It involves tracing how a change to one part of the code influences other parts, which is crucial for maintaining stability and writing effective tests.

**Simplifying Effect Sketches** is a method used to visualize and understand these propagations. It involves creating a mental or physical "sketch" of how data and methods interact within a class, which helps to identify the minimal set of tests needed to ensure that changes do not introduce errors.

### Key Concepts

1. **Effect Propagation**: 
   - Changes to a class or method can affect multiple other methods or classes.
   - Effects propagate through methods that return values, modify parameters, or change static/global data.
   - For example, if a method returns a value, changes to that method may impact all the places where that return value is used.

2. **Simplifying Effect Sketches**:
   - Creating a visual or mental map (an effect sketch) of the class shows how changes in one part of a class affect other parts.
   - This helps to identify which methods or interactions are most relevant for testing.
   - Simplifying these sketches often means reducing overlap in functionality, making it easier to focus tests on fewer critical methods.

### Example: CppClass and Effect Sketches

In the original example, a class called `CppClass` has a list of `declarations` and methods that operate on it:

```java
public class CppClass {
    private String name;
    private List<Declaration> declarations;

    public CppClass(String name, List<Declaration> declarations) {
        this.name = name;
        this.declarations = declarations;
    }

    public int getDeclarationCount() {
        return declarations.size();
    }

    public Declaration getDeclaration(int index) {
        return declarations.get(index);
    }

    public String getInterface(String interfaceName, int[] indices) {
        String result = "class " + interfaceName + " {\npublic:\n";
        for (int n = 0; n < indices.length; n++) {
            Declaration virtualFunction = getDeclaration(indices[n]);
            result += "\t" + virtualFunction.asAbstract() + "\n";
        }
        result += "};\n";
        return result;
    }
}
```

#### Effect Sketch Analysis

1. **Identifying the Change Points**:
   - Suppose we want to change how the `getInterface` method constructs its output. This method interacts with the `declarations` list through the `getDeclaration` method.

2. **Effect Sketch of `CppClass`**:
   - The `declarations` list affects several methods:
     - `getDeclarationCount()`: Returns the size of the `declarations`.
     - `getDeclaration(int index)`: Retrieves a specific `Declaration`.
     - `getInterface(String interfaceName, int[] indices)`: Uses `getDeclaration` internally to generate the class interface.

3. **Simplifying the Effect Sketch**:
   - If `getInterface` directly calls `getDeclaration`, testing `getInterface` can implicitly test `getDeclaration` as well, since any error in `getDeclaration` will surface when `getInterface` is tested.
   - This simplifies the testing process, as writing thorough tests for `getInterface` can ensure that the behavior of `getDeclaration` is covered without needing separate tests for every possible interaction.

### Swift Example: Translating the Theory

Now let’s translate this concept to a Swift example with a similar structure:

```swift
class SwiftClass {
    private var declarations: [String]

    init(declarations: [String]) {
        self.declarations = declarations
    }

    // Returns the number of declarations.
    func getDeclarationCount() -> Int {
        return declarations.count
    }

    // Returns a declaration at a given index.
    func getDeclaration(at index: Int) -> String? {
        guard index >= 0 && index < declarations.count else { return nil }
        return declarations[index]
    }

    // Generates an interface string using the given indices.
    func getInterface(interfaceName: String, indices: [Int]) -> String {
        var result = "class \(interfaceName) {\npublic:\n"
        for index in indices {
            if let declaration = getDeclaration(at: index) {
                result += "\t\(declaration)\n"
            }
        }
        result += "};\n"
        return result
    }
}
```

#### Effect Sketch Analysis in Swift

1. **Identifying Change Points**:
   - Suppose we want to change how `getInterface` works, like modifying the output format.
   - `getInterface` depends on `getDeclaration(at:)` to retrieve declarations for specific indices.

2. **Effect Sketch for `SwiftClass`**:
   - `declarations` affects:
     - `getDeclarationCount()`: Which returns the count of `declarations`.
     - `getDeclaration(at:)`: Which fetches a specific declaration.
     - `getInterface(interfaceName:indices:)`: Which constructs an interface using declarations retrieved by `getDeclaration(at:)`.

3. **Simplifying the Sketch**:
   - By ensuring `getInterface` uses `getDeclaration(at:)`, any tests written for `getInterface` will also validate that `getDeclaration(at:)` is functioning as expected.
   - For example, testing that `getInterface` produces the correct class structure implicitly tests that `getDeclaration(at:)` returns the expected values.

### Example Tests in Swift

Here’s how you could write tests to cover the functionality:

```swift
import XCTest

class SwiftClassTests: XCTestCase {

    func testGetDeclarationCount() {
        let swiftClass = SwiftClass(declarations: ["func foo()", "func bar()"])
        XCTAssertEqual(swiftClass.getDeclarationCount(), 2)
    }

    func testGetDeclaration() {
        let swiftClass = SwiftClass(declarations: ["func foo()", "func bar()"])
        XCTAssertEqual(swiftClass.getDeclaration(at: 0), "func foo()")
        XCTAssertNil(swiftClass.getDeclaration(at: 2))  // Out-of-bounds check
    }

    func testGetInterface() {
        let swiftClass = SwiftClass(declarations: ["func foo()", "func bar()"])
        let result = swiftClass.getInterface(interfaceName: "TestInterface", indices: [0, 1])
        XCTAssertTrue(result.contains("class TestInterface"))
        XCTAssertTrue(result.contains("\tfunc foo()"))
        XCTAssertTrue(result.contains("\tfunc bar()"))
    }
}
```

### Summary

- **Effect Propagation** helps in understanding how changes to methods or properties affect other parts of the code.
- **Effect Sketches** visually map these dependencies, making it easier to determine where to place tests.
- **Simplifying Effect Sketches** by reducing the number of interactions between methods or making some methods rely on others can help focus testing on fewer methods, ensuring comprehensive coverage with less effort.
- In the Swift example, testing `getInterface` covers `getDeclaration` implicitly, making the tests simpler and more focused.

By understanding these concepts and applying them to both analysis and code-writing practices, you can make code changes with greater confidence and create more maintainable systems.
