### Problem Overview: Effect Propagation

When working with a codebase—especially one that may have legacy code or lacks tests—understanding **effect propagation** is crucial. This means knowing how changes in one part of the code affect other parts, both directly and indirectly. Effects can propagate in several ways, some of which are easy to trace, while others might be more subtle.

In the example provided, changes in the `Element` class affect other parts of the application through a method called `addText`, which now interacts with the view system via a static method. This change introduces hidden dependencies and potential side effects that are not immediately visible through the method signatures.

### Theory of Effect Propagation

**Effect Propagation** refers to how changes in one method or part of a class can influence other parts of the codebase. It often follows three main paths:
1. **Return Values**: Methods that return values directly affect the code that calls them, as those values may be used or transformed further.
2. **Modification of Parameters**: When methods receive parameters (especially objects), they can alter the state of those objects, which might impact the rest of the application if those objects are used elsewhere.
3. **Modification of Static or Global Data**: The most hidden way effects propagate is through changes to global or static data. These can alter application-wide state and can be difficult to trace, as they aren’t tied to any specific object instances.

### Example in Swift

Let’s illustrate this with an example similar to the `Element` class from before but written in Swift, with each propagation method:

#### Swift Example

```swift
class Element {
    let name: String
    private var text: String = ""

    init(name: String) {
        self.name = name
    }

    // Method with a return value
    func getText() -> String {
        return text
    }

    // Method that modifies an object parameter
    func appendText(to otherElement: inout Element, newText: String) {
        otherElement.text += newText
    }

    // Method that modifies a global variable
    func addTextWithGlobal(newText: String) {
        text += newText
        // Modifies a global/static variable or singleton
        Logger.shared.log(newText)
    }
}

// Example of a global or singleton logger class
class Logger {
    static let shared = Logger()
    private var logs: [String] = []

    func log(_ message: String) {
        logs.append(message)
        print("Log updated: \(message)")
    }

    func getLogs() -> [String] {
        return logs
    }
}
```

In this example:
- **Return Values**: The `getText()` method returns the `text` value of an `Element` object. Any code that calls `getText()` can use this value, and thus, any changes in how `getText()` works will affect those callers.
  
- **Modification of Parameters**: The `appendText(to:newText:)` method takes another `Element` object as an `inout` parameter, allowing it to directly modify the `text` property of that object. Any changes to `appendText` will impact all `Element` instances passed into it.

- **Modification of Static Data**: The `addTextWithGlobal(newText:)` method updates the `Logger` singleton by adding a new log entry. This method not only modifies the internal state of the `Element` instance but also changes the state of `Logger`, which is shared across the application. Any code that accesses `Logger` will see the updated logs.

### How to Detect and Test for Propagation in Swift

To ensure the effects of changes are correctly managed, it’s crucial to:
1. **Trace Return Values**:
   - Look at methods like `getText()` and identify where they are used. If you change how `text` is generated, update tests for all callers of `getText()`.
   
2. **Check for Parameter Modifications**:
   - The `appendText(to:newText:)` method can change the state of `otherElement`. You’ll need to ensure that tests check if `otherElement` reflects the correct changes after calling this method.

3. **Monitor Global and Static Data Changes**:
   - Changes in `addTextWithGlobal(newText:)` affect the `Logger` class. Tests should verify that the `Logger` has the expected log entries after `addTextWithGlobal` is called.

#### Swift Tests Example

Here’s how you might write tests to capture the effects:

```swift
import XCTest

class ElementTests: XCTestCase {

    func testGetTextReturnsCorrectValue() {
        let element = Element(name: "TestElement")
        XCTAssertEqual(element.getText(), "")
        
        element.addTextWithGlobal(newText: "Hello")
        XCTAssertEqual(element.getText(), "Hello")
    }

    func testAppendTextModifiesOtherElement() {
        var element1 = Element(name: "Element1")
        var element2 = Element(name: "Element2")
        
        element1.appendText(to: &element2, newText: " - Appended")
        XCTAssertEqual(element2.getText(), " - Appended")
    }

    func testAddTextWithGlobalLogsCorrectly() {
        let element = Element(name: "LoggerTestElement")
        element.addTextWithGlobal(newText: "New log entry")
        
        let logs = Logger.shared.getLogs()
        XCTAssertTrue(logs.contains("New log entry"))
    }
}
```

### Summary

**Effect propagation** is a critical concept when modifying code because it ensures you understand how your changes impact other parts of the application. In this Swift example, different methods in the `Element` class showcase how changes can spread through:
- **Return values** that influence callers.
- **Direct modifications** to parameters passed by reference.
- **Global state changes** through singletons like `Logger`.

By carefully tracing these effects and writing tests for each path, you can ensure that your changes don't introduce unexpected behavior in the application.
