The passage covers strategies to ensure that changes in code do not introduce unintended errors or break existing functionality. It emphasizes the importance of careful editing, testing, and collaboration to maintain code quality. Below is an explanation of each topic, along with examples, particularly in Swift, to help illustrate the concepts:

### 1. **Code Is Different from Physical Materials**
   - **Explanation**: Unlike physical materials (metal, wood, etc.) that wear out over time, code remains stable if left untouched. Software only "breaks" when someone modifies it. This introduces the challenge that most issues or bugs are introduced through changes by developers.
   - **Example in Swift**: Suppose you have a `Car` class in Swift:
     ```swift
     class Car {
         var speed: Int
         
         init(speed: Int) {
             self.speed = speed
         }
         
         func accelerate() {
             speed += 10
         }
     }
     ```
     If you change `accelerate()` to accidentally subtract speed instead of adding it, the class behavior will change:
     ```swift
     func accelerate() {
         speed -= 10 // This change introduces a bug.
     }
     ```
     The code was working fine until this change was introduced, demonstrating that software errors often come from edits.

### 2. **Hyperaware Editing**
   - **Explanation**: This involves being conscious of each change you make to the code and understanding its impact. It’s about distinguishing between changes that modify behavior and those that do not (like comments or formatting). Hyperaware editing helps prevent mistakes by fostering a flow state where every change is deliberate.
   - **Example in Swift**: When editing a method in Swift, like adding a new feature to a function, you would check how it impacts the existing functionality:
     ```swift
     func greet(user: String) -> String {
         return "Hello, \(user)"
     }
     ```
     If you change it to:
     ```swift
     func greet(user: String) -> String {
         return "Hi, \(user)! How are you?" // This is a functional change.
     }
     ```
     You need to be aware that this change will alter the output everywhere `greet(user:)` is called, and you should verify this change with tests.

### 3. **Single-Goal Editing**
   - **Explanation**: This principle encourages focusing on one change at a time rather than trying to address multiple things simultaneously. It helps to avoid mistakes by allowing you to concentrate fully on each task.
   - **Example in Swift**: If you need to refactor a `calculateDiscount` method in a `ShoppingCart` class, focus solely on that method instead of trying to clean up other parts of the class:
     ```swift
     class ShoppingCart {
         func calculateDiscount() {
             // Refactor this method first.
         }
         
         func calculateTotal() {
             // Don't touch this method until you finish refactoring `calculateDiscount`.
         }
     }
     ```
     Finish refactoring `calculateDiscount` and verify that it works before moving on to `calculateTotal`.

### 4. **Preserve Signatures**
   - **Explanation**: When refactoring or modifying code, try to avoid changing method signatures (name or parameters) unless absolutely necessary. This minimizes the risk of introducing errors, as you’re not altering how methods are called.
   - **Example in Swift**: Suppose you have a method:
     ```swift
     func addProduct(product: String, quantity: Int) {
         // Logic to add product
     }
     ```
     If you need to change its functionality internally, keep the method signature the same:
     ```swift
     func addProduct(product: String, quantity: Int) {
         // Updated logic
     }
     ```
     This allows the rest of the code that calls `addProduct` to remain unchanged, reducing the chance of introducing new issues.

### 5. **Lean on the Compiler**
   - **Explanation**: In statically typed languages like Swift, the compiler can help catch certain types of errors automatically. By changing type declarations or method signatures, you can identify where in the code adjustments need to be made, as the compiler will show errors where the changes are not yet addressed.
   - **Example in Swift**: Suppose you want to change a property from `Int` to `Double`:
     ```swift
     class Account {
         var balance: Int
     }
     ```
     Change it to:
     ```swift
     class Account {
         var balance: Double
     }
     ```
     The compiler will show errors wherever `balance` was used with `Int` operations. This allows you to methodically fix each issue, making the necessary adjustments to handle `Double` values correctly.

### 6. **Pair Programming**
   - **Explanation**: Pair programming involves two developers working together on the same codebase. One types while the other reviews, offering immediate feedback and helping catch mistakes. It’s especially useful for challenging tasks like refactoring legacy code.
   - **Example in Swift**: When refactoring a complex `Networking` class, you might have one developer refactor a method while the other verifies that the changes align with the overall architecture:
     ```swift
     class Networking {
         func fetchData() {
             // Developer A refactors this method.
         }
         
         func parseData() {
             // Developer B reviews the impact of the changes.
         }
     }
     ```
     The collaboration helps ensure that the changes to `fetchData()` don't introduce bugs or break `parseData()`.

These practices, including writing tests and using modern development techniques like test-driven development (TDD), help maintain the stability of the software while making changes. For example, in Swift, using XCTest to write unit tests can help validate that changes haven't broken any functionality.
