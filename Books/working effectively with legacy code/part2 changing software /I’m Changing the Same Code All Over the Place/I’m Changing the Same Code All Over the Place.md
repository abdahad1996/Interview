Certainly! Let's dive deeper into this refactoring process and cover all the related concepts in detail, with specific focus on Swift. We'll touch on the following topics:

1. **Understanding the Problem: Code Duplication**: Recognizing where duplication happens and why it’s a problem.
2. **Refactoring Techniques**: Techniques for removing duplication.
3. **Abstracting Shared Behavior**: Using inheritance or protocols for common behavior.
4. **Applying the Open/Closed Principle**: How the refactoring aligns with this principle.
5. **Creating Testable Code**: Ensuring that refactoring doesn't break functionality.
6. **Evaluating Refactoring Benefits**: Understanding the benefits of reduced duplication.
7. **Orthogonality and Code Design**: How the refactoring process improves independence between parts of the code.

Let's work through these topics with the same example, adapted and expanded for Swift.

### 1. Understanding the Problem: Code Duplication

**Issue:** In the initial code, we have two classes (`AddEmployeeCmd` and `LoginCommand`) that perform similar actions:
- Both write a header, calculate the size, and write data fields to an output stream.
- They have almost identical `write` methods but differ slightly in what fields they handle and their respective command characters.

**Why is this a Problem?**
- **Maintenance Burden**: Every time a change is needed (e.g., changing how fields are written), it must be applied to both classes separately.
- **Increased Risk of Errors**: Duplication increases the chance of introducing inconsistencies or bugs.
- **Scalability Issues**: Adding new commands would require copying and adapting existing code, further increasing duplication.

### 2. Refactoring Techniques

**Refactoring** is the process of restructuring existing code without changing its external behavior. It aims to improve readability, reduce complexity, and eliminate duplication.

**Key Refactoring Techniques Applied:**
- **Extract Method**: Moving common code into a separate method (e.g., `writeField` for writing strings with null terminators).
- **Pull Up Method**: Moving a common method from subclasses to a superclass (e.g., moving `write` to `Command`).
- **Introduce Parameter**: Abstracting variations into parameters or properties (e.g., using `fields` and `commandChar`).

### 3. Abstracting Shared Behavior

In Swift, we can use **inheritance** to extract common logic into a superclass and have specific subclasses override parts that differ.

#### Example: Abstracting into a Base Class (`Command`)

```swift
import Foundation

class Command {
    // Shared properties
    let header: [UInt8] = [0xde, 0xad]
    let footer: [UInt8] = [0xbe, 0xef]
    let sizeLength: Int = 1
    let cmdByteLength: Int = 1
    var fields: [String] = []

    // Abstract method for subclasses to provide their command character.
    func getCommandChar() -> [UInt8] {
        fatalError("Subclasses need to implement this method.")
    }

    // Common method for writing body data.
    func writeBody(to outputStream: OutputStream) {
        for field in fields {
            writeField(outputStream: outputStream, field: field)
        }
    }

    // Calculate the overall size of the message.
    func getSize() -> Int {
        let bodySize = fields.reduce(0) { $0 + getFieldSize($1) }
        return header.count + sizeLength + cmdByteLength + footer.count + bodySize
    }

    // Helper method to calculate the size of a field.
    func getFieldSize(_ field: String) -> Int {
        return field.utf8.count + 1 // Add 1 for the null terminator.
    }

    // Helper method to write a field to the output stream.
    func writeField(outputStream: OutputStream, field: String) {
        if let data = field.data(using: .utf8) {
            outputStream.write(data.withUnsafeBytes { $0.bindMemory(to: UInt8.self).baseAddress! }, maxLength: data.count)
            outputStream.write([0x00], maxLength: 1) // Null terminator.
        }
    }

    // Main method to write the complete command.
    func write(to outputStream: OutputStream) {
        outputStream.write(header, maxLength: header.count)
        outputStream.write([UInt8(getSize())], maxLength: 1)
        outputStream.write(getCommandChar(), maxLength: 1)
        writeBody(to: outputStream)
        outputStream.write(footer, maxLength: footer.count)
    }
}
```

#### Specific Command Subclasses

```swift
class AddEmployeeCommand: Command {
    init(name: String, address: String, city: String, state: String, yearlySalary: Int) {
        super.init()
        fields.append(name)
        fields.append(address)
        fields.append(city)
        fields.append(state)
        fields.append(String(yearlySalary))
    }

    override func getCommandChar() -> [UInt8] {
        return [0x02]
    }
}

class LoginCommand: Command {
    init(userName: String, password: String) {
        super.init()
        fields.append(userName)
        fields.append(password)
    }

    override func getCommandChar() -> [UInt8] {
        return [0x01]
    }
}
```

### 4. Applying the Open/Closed Principle

**Open/Closed Principle**: A class should be open for extension but closed for modification. This means we should be able to extend the functionality of a class without changing its existing code.

**How Does the Refactoring Align?**
- The `Command` class can be extended to add new commands without modifying its internal logic.
- Adding a new command requires only a new subclass that specifies its `commandChar` and fields.
- This minimizes the risk of introducing bugs when adding new functionality.

### 5. Creating Testable Code

When refactoring, it is essential to maintain a set of tests to ensure that the refactored code still behaves correctly.

**Testing Strategy:**
- Write unit tests for `Command` to ensure it writes headers, footers, and fields correctly.
- Write tests for `AddEmployeeCommand` and `LoginCommand` to verify that they handle their specific fields and `commandChar` properly.
- Use mocks or stubs for the `OutputStream` to verify the data being written.

Example in Swift:
```swift
import XCTest

class CommandTests: XCTestCase {
    func testAddEmployeeCommandWritesCorrectData() {
        let outputStream = OutputStream.toMemory()
        outputStream.open()
        let command = AddEmployeeCommand(name: "John", address: "123 Elm St", city: "Springfield", state: "IL", yearlySalary: 50000)
        command.write(to: outputStream)
        outputStream.close()
        
        // Verify that the written data matches the expected format.
        // Example: Compare data in `outputStream` with expected byte array.
    }

    func testLoginCommandWritesCorrectData() {
        let outputStream = OutputStream.toMemory()
        outputStream.open()
        let command = LoginCommand(userName: "user", password: "password")
        command.write(to: outputStream)
        outputStream.close()
        
        // Verify the output stream contents.
    }
}
```

### 6. Evaluating Refactoring Benefits

After refactoring, we gain several advantages:
- **Readability**: The code is easier to read, with common logic centralized in the `Command` class.
- **Flexibility**: Adding new commands or changing how data is written requires fewer changes.
- **Reduced Duplication**: Duplication is minimized, making the code easier to maintain and update.
- **Reduced Errors**: Common functionality is written once, reducing the chance of mistakes.

### 7. Orthogonality and Code Design

**Orthogonality** in code means that each piece of functionality is independent of others. Changes to one part of the system don’t affect other parts.

**How Refactoring Improved Orthogonality:**
- By extracting common functionality into the `Command` class, we isolated the logic for writing headers, footers, and fields.
- If the way fields are written changes (e.g., the terminator changes from `0x00` to another byte), only `writeField` needs modification.
- The structure now resembles a series of **"knobs"**: each aspect of the behavior is controlled by a single method, making adjustments easy.

### Conclusion

By addressing code duplication with refactoring, we've transitioned from a maintenance-heavy system to one that is more modular and easier to extend. The process involved:
- Identifying duplicated code.
- Abstracting common behavior into a base class.
- Using inheritance to extend specific behaviors.
- Ensuring adherence to design principles like the Open/Closed Principle.
- Writing tests to maintain correctness.

This approach ultimately makes the codebase more maintainable, less error-prone, and more adaptable to future changes.
