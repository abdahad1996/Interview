Sure, let’s break down the **Parameterize Method** pattern in Swift step by step, using a detailed example based on the `TestCase` class.

### Objective of Parameterize Method

The goal of parameterizing a method is to make it more flexible by allowing an external object to be passed in instead of being created within the method. This can be helpful when:
1. We want more control over which object is used in the method.
2. We want to test the method with different variations of the object.
3. We want to reduce dependencies inside the method, making it more modular and testable.

### Problem Setup

We have a `TestCase` class that represents a test case in a testing framework. This class has a method called `run()`, which:
1. Creates a `TestResult` object to hold the results of the test.
2. Sets up, runs, and tears down the test.
3. Adds any failures to the `TestResult` if an error occurs.

Here’s how this might look in Swift:

```swift
class TestResult {
    func addFailure(_ error: Error, _ testCase: TestCase) {
        // Handle failure logic
    }
}

class TestCase {
    private var result: TestResult?

    // Method to run the test case
    func run() {
        // Creates a new TestResult internally each time run() is called
        result = TestResult()
        
        do {
            setUp()
            runTest(result!)
        } catch {
            result?.addFailure(error, self)
        }
        
        tearDown()
    }

    // Placeholder methods for setting up, running, and tearing down the test
    func setUp() {
        // Setup logic
    }

    func runTest(_ result: TestResult) {
        // Test logic using the result instance
    }

    func tearDown() {
        // Teardown logic
    }
}
```

In the current setup:
- Every time `run()` is called, a new `TestResult` is created internally.
- If we want to test `TestCase` with different types of `TestResult` objects, this is difficult because `TestCase` doesn’t allow us to inject or pass in an external `TestResult`.

### Parameterizing the `run()` Method

To address this, we can **parameterize** the `run()` method. This means modifying `run()` to accept a `TestResult` instance as a parameter, allowing us to pass in any instance we want.

#### Step 1: Create a New Parameterized Method

1. Add a new method, `run(with result: TestResult)`, which takes a `TestResult` object as a parameter.
2. Inside this method, assign the passed `result` to the `result` property.
3. Remove the line that creates a new `TestResult`, as we’re now using the one provided externally.

Here’s how the new method looks:

```swift
class TestCase {
    private var result: TestResult?

    // New parameterized method that accepts a TestResult object
    func run(with result: TestResult) {
        // Use the provided result instead of creating a new one
        self.result = result
        
        do {
            setUp()
            runTest(result)
        } catch {
            result.addFailure(error, self)
        }
        
        tearDown()
    }

    // Existing method updated to call the parameterized method
    func run() {
        // Calls the new method with a default TestResult instance
        run(with: TestResult())
    }

    func setUp() {
        // Setup logic
    }

    func runTest(_ result: TestResult) {
        // Test logic using the result instance
    }

    func tearDown() {
        // Teardown logic
    }
}
```

#### Step 2: Update the Original `run()` Method to Use the Parameterized Version

1. The original `run()` method can now be simplified to call the new `run(with:)` method.
2. We pass a new `TestResult` instance to `run(with:)`, keeping the original functionality intact.

This way, we have two versions of the `run()` method:
- The **original `run()`** method, which creates a `TestResult` instance and calls `run(with:)`.
- The **new `run(with:)`** method, which uses the provided `TestResult` instance.

### Why Parameterize?

With this setup, we have more flexibility in how we use `TestCase`. Here are a few benefits:

1. **Customizability**: We can pass any `TestResult` instance to `run(with:)`, allowing us to use different versions or subclasses of `TestResult` if needed.
  
2. **Testability**: In testing, we often need to see how code behaves with different objects. By parameterizing `run()`, we can pass a mock `TestResult` to observe and verify interactions without modifying the real object. For example:

   ```swift
   class MockTestResult: TestResult {
       var failureCount = 0
       
       override func addFailure(_ error: Error, _ testCase: TestCase) {
           failureCount += 1
       }
   }
   
   let testCase = TestCase()
   let mockResult = MockTestResult()
   
   testCase.run(with: mockResult)
   print(mockResult.failureCount)  // Verify how many failures were recorded
   ```

3. **Decoupling**: This approach minimizes dependencies within `TestCase` by allowing it to use any object conforming to the `TestResult` structure. `TestCase` no longer directly creates `TestResult`, making it easier to change the behavior by using different `TestResult` instances.

### Summary of Changes

1. **New Method**: `run(with:)` allows us to pass a `TestResult` instance, making the method flexible.
2. **Updated Original Method**: The original `run()` method calls `run(with:)`, ensuring backward compatibility.
3. **Testability and Flexibility**: We can now easily test `TestCase` with custom or mock `TestResult` objects, adding flexibility to the design.

This is a great technique when you want to decouple the creation of objects within methods, especially for testing purposes, or to allow future changes without altering the method's core logic.
