The *Extract Implementer* refactoring technique involves converting a concrete class into an interface, making its methods abstract, and moving all the implementation details to a new subclass. This approach allows for greater flexibility and abstraction, especially when we want to separate a class's interface from its concrete implementation. It’s particularly useful when we encounter naming conflicts or lack automated refactoring tools.

Here’s how to implement *Extract Implementer* in Swift:

### Steps

1. **Copy the Original Class:** Duplicate the class and rename the copy (e.g., `ProductionModelNode` for `ModelNode`).
2. **Convert the Original Class to a Protocol:** Delete all non-public methods and variables from the original class, making it abstract. Swift protocols serve as the interface here.
3. **Make Methods Abstract:** Define the protocol methods as required methods without an implementation. This turns the original class (now a protocol) into a purely abstract interface.
4. **Inherit the Interface in the Subclass:** Have the new subclass conform to the protocol and implement the methods.

### Example in Swift

Imagine a class `ModelNode` that manages nodes in a model with some operations. We’ll transform it into an interface and create a concrete subclass, `ProductionModelNode`, that implements its details.

#### Step 1: Original Class `ModelNode`

```swift
class ModelNode {
    private var interiorNodes: [ModelNode] = []
    private var exteriorNodes: [ModelNode] = []
    private var weight: Double = 0.0
    
    func addExteriorNode(_ newNode: ModelNode) {
        exteriorNodes.append(newNode)
    }
    
    func addInternalNode(_ newNode: ModelNode) {
        interiorNodes.append(newNode)
    }
    
    func colorize() {
        print("Colorizing the node")
    }
}
```

#### Step 2: Define the `ModelNode` Protocol (Interface)

Convert `ModelNode` into a protocol that defines the structure but not the implementation. The protocol has only the abstract method signatures, making it act as an interface.

```swift
protocol ModelNode {
    func addExteriorNode(_ newNode: ModelNode)
    func addInternalNode(_ newNode: ModelNode)
    func colorize()
}
```

#### Step 3: Create `ProductionModelNode` Subclass

Create `ProductionModelNode`, which conforms to the `ModelNode` protocol and contains the concrete implementations.

```swift
class ProductionModelNode: ModelNode {
    private var interiorNodes: [ModelNode] = []
    private var exteriorNodes: [ModelNode] = []
    private var weight: Double = 0.0
    
    func addExteriorNode(_ newNode: ModelNode) {
        exteriorNodes.append(newNode)
    }
    
    func addInternalNode(_ newNode: ModelNode) {
        interiorNodes.append(newNode)
    }
    
    func colorize() {
        print("Colorizing the node")
    }
}
```

### Explanation

1. **Protocol Definition (`ModelNode`):** Defines the essential methods without providing any implementation. Swift protocols allow defining behavior without specific details, much like abstract classes in other languages.
2. **Concrete Class (`ProductionModelNode`):** Implements the required methods, handling all the details of the `ModelNode` class.

### Benefits of This Approach

- **Flexibility:** Separating the interface and implementation allows different implementations (e.g., `MockModelNode` for testing).
- **Abstraction:** Other parts of the code interact with the `ModelNode` protocol without needing to know the concrete implementation.
- **Dependency Reduction:** It becomes easier to replace or mock components, reducing dependencies and improving testability.

This technique can be powerful in larger codebases where separating interface and implementation is crucial for maintainability and scalability.
