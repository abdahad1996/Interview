**Extract and Override Call** is a technique used in programming to break dependencies for testing purposes. It allows you to isolate a specific method call so you can replace its behavior when testing. This helps avoid unwanted side effects or allows you to control the output of a particular function call during tests. The key idea is to extract a method call into a separate, overridable method, making it easier to change or mock the method's behavior in a testing subclass.

### Example in Swift

Let's translate the provided Java example into Swift and go through the process:

1. **Original Class with Dependency**: Here, we have a `PageLayout` class that has a method `rebindStyles()` that directly calls a method from another class (`StyleMaster.formStyles`). This dependency could make testing difficult, especially if `StyleMaster` has side effects or requires specific setup.

```swift
class PageLayout {
    private var id: Int = 0
    private var styles: [String] = []
    private var template: StyleTemplate
    
    init(template: StyleTemplate) {
        self.template = template
    }
    
    func rebindStyles() {
        styles = StyleMaster.formStyles(template: template, id: id)
    }
}
```

Here, `rebindStyles()` calls `StyleMaster.formStyles`, which means we cannot easily test `PageLayout` without dealing with `StyleMaster`.

2. **Extracting the Call into a Method**: To break the dependency, we extract the call to `StyleMaster.formStyles` into a separate, overridable method `formStyles()`.

```swift
class PageLayout {
    private var id: Int = 0
    private var styles: [String] = []
    private var template: StyleTemplate
    
    init(template: StyleTemplate) {
        self.template = template
    }
    
    func rebindStyles() {
        styles = formStyles(template: template, id: id)
    }
    
    func formStyles(template: StyleTemplate, id: Int) -> [String] {
        return StyleMaster.formStyles(template: template, id: id)
    }
}
```

Now, `rebindStyles()` uses a local method `formStyles()` instead of calling `StyleMaster.formStyles` directly. This method can be overridden in a testing subclass.

3. **Creating a Testing Subclass**: In a test, we can subclass `PageLayout` and override `formStyles()` to return a mock value, making it easier to test `rebindStyles()` without being affected by `StyleMaster`.

```swift
class TestingPageLayout: PageLayout {
    override func formStyles(template: StyleTemplate, id: Int) -> [String] {
        // Return a mock value instead of calling StyleMaster.formStyles
        return ["mockStyle1", "mockStyle2"]
    }
}

// In a test:
let mockTemplate = StyleTemplate()  // Assume this is a valid mock or stub of StyleTemplate
let testLayout = TestingPageLayout(template: mockTemplate)
testLayout.rebindStyles()
// Now, `testLayout` uses the overridden `formStyles` method.
```

In the testing subclass, `formStyles()` is overridden to return a mock list of styles. This allows you to verify that `rebindStyles()` correctly sets `styles` without relying on the behavior of `StyleMaster`.

### Why Use This Approach?

- **Control Over Dependencies**: By overriding `formStyles()` in a testing subclass, you control what `rebindStyles()` does without needing the real implementation of `StyleMaster`.
- **Isolation in Tests**: This method helps isolate the class under test, ensuring that changes in `StyleMaster` do not affect tests for `PageLayout`.
- **Flexibility in Testing**: As you develop more tests, you can adjust `formStyles()` in different ways, returning various styles that match your test cases.

### Key Takeaways

- **Extract and Override Call** involves moving a specific method call into a separate method that can be overridden in a subclass.
- This is useful for breaking dependencies on static methods, global references, or other complex dependencies.
- It makes testing simpler and more reliable by allowing you to control the behavior of the extracted method.
