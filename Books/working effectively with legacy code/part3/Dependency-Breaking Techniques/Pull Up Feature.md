### Problem Explanation

In software design, sometimes classes become cluttered with multiple responsibilities, making it hard to isolate and test individual features. Here, we have a class called `Scheduler` that has various methods and dependencies, some of which are difficult to work with in a test environment. For instance:

- The `Scheduler` class has methods that interact with a database, like `validate()`, which are difficult to mock or bypass during testing.
- Our goal is to test a specific method, `calculateDeadtime()`, without dealing with these external dependencies.

The problem arises because `calculateDeadtime()` relies on some parts of the `Scheduler` class, but not on others (like the database-dependent `validate()` method). To avoid the complex setup or dealing with dependencies that aren’t needed, we want to “pull up” `calculateDeadtime()` and any helper methods it requires into an abstract superclass. This lets us isolate the functionality we want to test without changing the existing structure of the `Scheduler` class.

### Solution in Detail

The **Pull Up Feature** is a refactoring technique where we move certain methods into an abstract superclass, allowing us to separate concerns and test isolated functionalities. Here’s how we can achieve this in Swift with our `Scheduler` class.

#### Step 1: Define Supporting Components

First, let’s create a `ScheduleItem` class that `Scheduler` will use to manage scheduling items. This class will represent an individual scheduling item with properties like `setupTime` and `finishTime`.

```swift
class ScheduleItem {
    enum ItemType {
        case transient
        case basic
    }
    
    let type: ItemType
    let setupTime: Int
    let finishTime: Int
    
    init(type: ItemType, setupTime: Int, finishTime: Int) {
        self.type = type
        self.setupTime = setupTime
        self.finishTime = finishTime
    }
    
    func getSetupTime() -> Int {
        return setupTime
    }
    
    func getFinishTime() -> Int {
        return finishTime
    }
}
```

#### Step 2: Create the Abstract Superclass `SchedulingServices`

We know `calculateDeadtime()` doesn’t depend on `Scheduler`'s database calls, so we’ll move it (along with its helper methods) into an abstract superclass, `SchedulingServices`. This will enable testing `calculateDeadtime()` without the dependencies that complicate testing.

```swift
class SchedulingServices {
    var items: [ScheduleItem] = []
    
    func notShared(item: ScheduleItem) -> Bool {
        // Placeholder logic to determine if an item is shared
        return true
    }
    
    func clockTime() -> Int {
        // Placeholder for clock time calculation
        return 10
    }
    
    func getStandardFinish(item: ScheduleItem) -> Int {
        // Placeholder for a standard finish time
        return item.getFinishTime()
    }
    
    func calculateDeadtime() -> Int {
        var result = 0
        for item in items {
            if item.type != .transient && notShared(item: item) {
                result += item.getSetupTime() + clockTime()
            }
            result += (item.type == .transient) ? getStandardFinish(item: item) : item.getFinishTime()
        }
        return result
    }
}
```

In `SchedulingServices`:
- We include only methods and properties required by `calculateDeadtime()`.
- `items` is defined here so that `calculateDeadtime()` can access it without relying on `Scheduler`.
- Helper methods like `notShared`, `clockTime`, and `getStandardFinish` are implemented as placeholders.

This setup allows `SchedulingServices` to perform necessary calculations while avoiding dependencies like database calls.

#### Step 3: Define the `Scheduler` Class with Dependencies

Now, we update `Scheduler` to inherit from `SchedulingServices` but keep the methods that depend on external resources, like `updateScheduleItem` and `validate`.

```swift
class Scheduler: SchedulingServices {
    
    func updateScheduleItem(item: ScheduleItem) throws {
        // Calls the validate function that may connect to a database
        try validate(item: item)
        // Additional scheduling logic
    }
    
    private func validate(item: ScheduleItem) throws {
        // Logic that depends on external systems like a database
    }
}
```

Here:
- `Scheduler` inherits `calculateDeadtime()` from `SchedulingServices`.
- `validate()` remains in `Scheduler` because it relies on external systems (e.g., a database).
- This separation allows us to test `calculateDeadtime()` independently without invoking `Scheduler`'s dependencies.

#### Step 4: Create a Testing Subclass

We now create a concrete subclass, `TestingSchedulingServices`, to use in our tests. This subclass doesn’t need any of the dependencies in `Scheduler` and allows us to easily add test items for `calculateDeadtime()`.

```swift
class TestingSchedulingServices: SchedulingServices {
    
    func addItem(_ item: ScheduleItem) {
        items.append(item)
    }
}
```

- `TestingSchedulingServices` inherits `calculateDeadtime()` and other methods from `SchedulingServices`.
- We add a helper method, `addItem()`, for convenient testing setup.

#### Step 5: Write Unit Tests

Finally, we can test `calculateDeadtime()` using `TestingSchedulingServices`, avoiding any dependencies in `Scheduler`.

```swift
import XCTest

class SchedulingServicesTest: XCTestCase {
    
    func testCalculateDeadtime() {
        let testServices = TestingSchedulingServices()
        testServices.addItem(ScheduleItem(type: .basic, setupTime: 10, finishTime: 20))
        
        let result = testServices.calculateDeadtime()
        
        XCTAssertEqual(result, 40)  // Expected result based on the setup
    }
}
```

### Solution Summary

- **Abstract Superclass**: We moved `calculateDeadtime()` and its helper methods to `SchedulingServices`, an abstract superclass, to isolate them from dependencies.
- **Testing Subclass**: We created `TestingSchedulingServices` to add test items without dependencies.
- **Decoupling Dependencies**: This allows us to test `calculateDeadtime()` without the unnecessary complexity of `Scheduler`.

### Design Trade-offs

While this solution enables testing, it can make code maintenance more complex, as functionalities are spread across classes. Over time, a better solution might be to refactor further by introducing more dependency injection or helper classes, but the **Pull Up Feature** is a helpful intermediate step for simplifying testing.
